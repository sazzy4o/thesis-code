   Candy watched the bearded man drive his silver BMW into the convenience store parking lot and pull around to the side, near the back corner of the building. There were plenty of open slots in the front, so she figured the guy was there for something other than a bag of chips and a coke.
A chilly breeze blew up her mini-skirt and she shivered. She pressed her legs together tightly to generate some heat. The knee-high boots protected her feet and calves, but her butt was freezing off.
She wrote down the license number as she circled around to the side of the expensive vehicle. He'll have a big wad of cash, she thought.
Larry Luzor had just stepped out of the car, when she said, "Nice car, Honey."
"Uh, thanks."
"I'm Candy. You got a sweet tooth tonight?"
He gave her the once over. Her black hair framed a pretty, young-looking face. The low-cut blouse left little to the imagination, barely hiding her nipples. She was average height, but the high heel boots elevated her to about 5'8". The long legs were very nice.
Larry had never used a prostitute. He'd always thought of it as revolting. The idea of having sex with a woman who'd been with hundreds of men did not appeal to him.
But this didn't seem like a typical hooker. She seemed too clean--almost pure. But of course, she wasn't. He knew she had to be just as skanky as the rest of them. Still--if he hadn't been in the middle of something important he might have been more than willing to buy what she was selling.
"So, what do you say? Want to get it on?" She smiled seductively.
He was impressed that she had all her teeth, and that they looked white.
"How can I resist?" He grinned at her and winked.

   Larry sat down at his laptop and logged in as Barry Undermine to complete another chapter of his serial novel, Illusion of Luck. He jittered with excitement at the realization of what he had just done. His clothing reeked of smoke from Erin's incineration. Hopefully by morning her remains would fit in an urn. But she didn't deserve one. So instead, he would dump her ashes into the rusty 55-gallon garbage drum on the other side of the dirt road.
His brain articulated the scene at hyper-speed, overloading his sixty-words-per-minute hands. It was so easy--just like the murder.
Wait. Not that easy, he thought. It wasn't as though he was simply taking dictation. No, not at all. He was a craftsman, an artist. He had six novels worth of experience under his belt. This time his writing was much better--but only because he had a better story idea. It was still fiction.
He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot.
His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene.
But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas.
He typed the last word of the chapter and clicked 'Publish.' Let's see how they like this one, he thought. Some of his readers had already signed up for instant email notification. So, it wouldn't be long before they'd be reading about the girlfriend's terrible demise.

   It was about 7:00 PM, and pitch black. As far as Larry could tell, there was no moonlight at all. The gas pole lamp provided just enough illumination for nighttime barbecuing. But now that his eyes had adjusted to it, he could barely see anything else. His only real point of reference was the light coming from the cabin windows. Without it, he could imagine himself getting lost and walking right into Lake Texoma.
He figured the temperature to be around 50 degrees. Probably about average for late February, he thought. He wasn't wearing a jacket, but felt plenty of warmth from the hot barbecue pit.
"Catch any big ones?" A deep voice boomed from somewhere out in the darkness.
Larry jumped.
The man's voice was approaching. "Me and my boys pulled in quite a haul today. I caught me an 8 lb. largemouth bass."
Larry strained to see the man, but couldn't. For all he could tell, it could have been a ghost, floating around in the darkness.
"Something smells good."
A big plaid shirt materialized at his side, and Larry jumped. Then he saw the jeans and the boots, and looked up to see the face. The guy was huge.
"Hi. My name is Jim." He grabbed Larry's hand and gave it a bone-crushing shake. "Me and Barb brought my three boys up for a long weekend of fishing. Yeah, I know what you're thinking: shouldn't them boys be in school? Nope. Cause I sent a note to their principal explaining how this is a part of the boys' education. Know what I mean, Guy?"
"Yeah...sure."
"Well, the principal didn't like it. He didn't like it one bit, and he got all huffy with me. But I told him I didn't give a durn what he thought. Sure, they gotta learn their three R's: reading, writing and 'rithmetic. Everybody knows that. But you gotta have some balance in life. Know what I mean?"

   It took Erin an hour and forty-five minutes to drive from their half-million dollar home in Plano to the small rented cabin at Lake Texoma, near the Oklahoma state line. It was Thursday night, and she could have been in their backyard, sitting by the pool in an ultra-skimpy bikini, drinking and laughing with her friends. Like every other night.
She walked in and slammed the door. "Okay, I'm here. Now, will you please tell me why it was so important for me to drive all the way up here tonight? You know I hate this place. And I had to cancel my party."
Larry glanced over at his super-hot 25-year-old girlfriend. Her body could still blow away most of the competition at a Miss America Pageant. "I'll explain. Just sit down and chill."
He looked back at his laptop. Larry wasn't a bad-looking 30-year old, if you could see past the scruffy beard and the long stringy hair.
She walked up behind him. "Who's that?"
"It's a girl I went to high school with."
"What about the guy?"
Larry didn't answer. He just puffed on his pipe.
Erin backed away. She hated his smoking, but he didn't care. "Why am I here, Larry? This place stinks like dead fish."
Larry kept his eyes on his laptop screen. "Well, this is a fish camp. But I do my best writing up here."
"Fine. But I don't need to be here. And let's face it, Honey--your best writing is just not good enough. When are you going to give it up? You've written six books--and you still don't have a publishing contract. You've got hundreds of rejection letters, and--"

   Greg Tenorly was the luckiest man in the world. The woman of his wildest dreams was standing beside him--at their wedding rehearsal. He knew he didn't deserve her. Anybody could see that. He saw himself as a balding, average-looking 35-year-old. Cynthia was a strikingly beautiful 30-year-old redhead. He wouldn't have been surprised if Cupid himself had flown in to break up the crazy mismatch.
But Cynthia saw something in Greg she couldn't resist. Something she should have looked for in the eyes of her first groom. Troy was a rugged, handsome man. Nothing wrong with that. But he was also an abuser. And all the love he'd ever given her meant nothing after that first brutal slap across the face. Then came the boozing and hitting and steady barrage of obscenities.
So, this time around Cynthia was looking for something different. Greg was kind and thoughtful and funny. And regardless of what Greg thought, she did find him attractive--even on their first meeting. And the more she got to know him, the more attractive he became. She wasn't marrying him just because he was a nice guy. She truly had the hots for him.
It was Thursday night, 6:20 PM. Greg and Cynthia were finishing up a run-through of the ceremony at First Baptist Church, Coreyville, where Greg was part-time music director. They were well on their way to happily ever after. Everything was perfect.
Until the phone call.
Cynthia's mother, Beverly, was serving as her Maid of Honor. She had girlfriends her age at First State Bank where she was a vice president. But her mom was her closest friend. It might have seemed a little odd to some people--no mother sitting on the second pew, crying. No father to walk her down the aisle and give her away. She wished so much he was still alive to share in the joy.

   I'm a senior at Cesar Chavez high in San Francisco's sunny Mission district, and that makes me one of the most surveilled people in the world. My name is Marcus Yallow, but back when this story starts, I was going by w1n5t0n. Pronounced "Winston."
Not pronounced "Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn" -- unless you're a clueless disciplinary officer who's far enough behind the curve that you still call the Internet "the information superhighway."
I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of three vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest wound of a human being. But if you're going to have a jailer, better a clueless one than one who's really on the ball.
"Marcus Yallow," he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn't very good to begin with, and when you combine that with Benson's habitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. But human beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion -- it's a survival trait.
I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut -- I didn't want to blow my downloads -- and got ready for the inevitable.
"Report to the administration office immediately."
My social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I rolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me, just because I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me (especially when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk to her brother who's stationed in Iraq).

   I actually managed a kind of sleep there, kneeling with the circulation cut off to my legs, my head in canvas twilight. My body had squirted a year's supply of adrenalin into my bloodstream in the space of 30 minutes, and while that stuff can give you the strength to lift cars off your loved ones and leap over tall buildings, the payback's always a bitch.
I woke up to someone pulling the hood off my head. They were neither rough nor careful -- just...impersonal. Like someone at McDonald's putting together burgers.
The light in the room was so bright I had to squeeze my eyes shut, but slowly I was able to open them to slits, then cracks, then all the way and look around.
We were all in the back of a truck, a big 16-wheeler. I could see the wheel-wells at regular intervals down the length. But the back of this truck had been turned into some kind of mobile command-post/jail. Steel desks lined the walls with banks of slick flat-panel displays climbing above them on articulated arms that let them be repositioned in a halo around the operators. Each desk had a gorgeous office-chair in front of it, festooned with user-interface knobs for adjusting every millimeter of the sitting surface, as well as height, pitch and yaw.
Then there was the jail part -- at the front of the truck, furthest away from the doors, there were steel rails bolted into the sides of the vehicle, and attached to these steel rails were the prisoners.
I spotted Van and Jolu right away. Darryl might have been in the remaining dozen shackled up back here, but it was impossible to say -- many of them were slumped over and blocking my view. It stank of sweat and fear back there.
Vanessa looked at me and bit her lip. She was scared. So was I. So was Jolu, his eyes rolling crazily in their sockets, the whites showing. I was scared. What's more, I had to piss like a race-horse.

   They set up a little screen at the end of the truck and then came for us one at a time, unshackling us and leading us to the back of the truck. As close as I could work it -- counting seconds off in my head, one hippopotami, two hippopotami -- the interviews lasted about seven minutes each. My head throbbed with dehydration and caffeine withdrawal.
I was third, brought back by the woman with the severe haircut. Up close, she looked tired, with bags under her eyes and grim lines at the corners of her mouth.
"Thanks," I said, automatically, as she unlocked me with a remote and then dragged me to my feet. I hated myself for the automatic politeness, but it had been drilled into me.
She didn't twitch a muscle. I went ahead of her to the back of the truck and behind the screen. There was a single folding chair and I sat in it. Two of them -- Severe Haircut woman and utility belt man -- looked at me from their ergonomic super-chairs.
They had a little table between them with the contents of my wallet and backpack spread out on it.
"Hello, Marcus," Severe Haircut woman said. "We have some questions for you."
"Am I under arrest?" I asked. This wasn't an idle question. If you're not under arrest, there are limits on what the cops can and can't do to you. For starters, they can't hold you forever without arresting you, giving you a phone call, and letting you talk to a lawyer. And hoo-boy, was I ever going to talk to a lawyer.
"What's this for?" she said, holding up my phone. The screen was showing the error message you got if you kept trying to get into its data without giving the right password. It was a bit of a rude message -- an animated hand giving a certain universally recognized gesture -- because I liked to customize my gear.

   They re-shackled and re-hooded me and left me there. A long time later, the truck started to move, rolling downhill, and then I was hauled back to my feet. I immediately fell over. My legs were so asleep they felt like blocks of ice, all except my knees, which were swollen and tender from all the hours of kneeling.
Hands grabbed my shoulders and feet and I was picked up like a sack of potatoes. There were indistinct voices around me. Someone crying. Someone cursing.
I was carried a short distance, then set down and re-shackled to another railing. My knees wouldn't support me anymore and I pitched forward, ending up twisted on the ground like a pretzel, straining against the chains holding my wrists.
Then we were moving again, and this time, it wasn't like driving in a truck. The floor beneath me rocked gently and vibrated with heavy diesel engines and I realized I was on a ship! My stomach turned to ice. I was being taken off America's shores to somewhere else, and who the hell knew where that was? I'd been scared before, but this thought terrified me, left me paralyzed and wordless with fear. I realized that I might never see my parents again and I actually tasted a little vomit burn up my throat. The bag over my head closed in on me and I could barely breathe, something that was compounded by the weird position I was twisted into.
But mercifully we weren't on the water for very long. It felt like an hour, but I know now that it was a mere fifteen minutes, and then I felt us docking, felt footsteps on the decking around me and felt other prisoners being unshackled and carried or led away. When they came for me, I tried to stand again, but couldn't, and they carried me again, impersonally, roughly.
When they took the hood off again, I was in a cell.

   But it was Van, and she was crying, and hugging me so hard I couldn't breathe. I didn't care. I hugged her back, my face buried in her hair.
"You're OK!" she said.
"I'm OK," I managed.
She finally let go of me and another set of arms wrapped themselves around me. It was Jolu! They were both there. He whispered, "You're safe, bro," in my ear and hugged me even tighter than Vanessa had.
When he let go, I looked around. "Where's Darryl?" I asked.
They both looked at each other. "Maybe he's still in the truck," Jolu said.
We turned and looked at the truck at the alley's end. It was a nondescript white 18-wheeler. Someone had already brought the little folding staircase inside. The rear lights glowed red, and the truck rolled backwards towards us, emitting a steady eep, eep, eep.
"Wait!" I shouted as it accelerated towards us. "Wait! What about Darryl?" The truck drew closer. I kept shouting. "What about Darryl?"
Jolu and Vanessa each had me by an arm and were dragging me away. I struggled against them, shouting. The truck pulled out of the alley's mouth and reversed into the street and pointed itself downhill and drove away. I tried to run after it, but Van and Jolu wouldn't let me go.
I sat down on the sidewalk and put my arms around my knees and cried. I cried and cried and cried, loud sobs of the sort I hadn't done since I was a little kid. They wouldn't stop coming. I couldn't stop shaking.
Vanessa and Jolu got me to my feet and moved me a little ways up the street. There was a Muni bus stop with a bench and they sat me on it. They were both crying too, and we held each other for a while, and I knew we were crying for Darryl, whom none of us ever expected to see again.

   That afternoon, Van left school as usual, sitting in the back of the bus with a tight knot of her friends, laughing and joking the way she always did. The other riders on the bus took special note of her, she was so loud, and besides, she was wearing that stupid, giant floppy hat, something that looked like a piece out of a school play about Renaissance sword fighters. At one point they all huddled together, then turned away to look out the back of the bus, pointing and giggling. The girl who wore the hat now was the same height as Van, and from behind, it could be her.
No one paid any attention to the mousy little Asian girl who got off a few stops before the BART. She was dressed in a plain old school uniform, and looking down shyly as she stepped off. Besides, at that moment, the loud Korean girl let out a whoop and her friends followed along, laughing so loudly that even the bus driver slowed down, twisted in his seat and gave them a dirty look.
Van hurried away down the street with her head down, her hair tied back and dropped down the collar of her out-of-style bubble jacket. She had slipped lifts into her shoes that made her two wobbly, awkward inches taller, and had taken her contacts out and put on her least-favored glasses, with huge lenses that took up half her face. Although I'd been waiting in the bus-shelter for her and knew when to expect her, I hardly recognized her. I got up and walked along behind her, across the street, trailing by half a block.
The people who passed me looked away as quickly as possible. I looked like a homeless kid, with a grubby cardboard sign, street-grimy overcoat, huge, overstuffed knapsack with duct-tape over its rips. No one wants to look at a street-kid, because if you meet his eye, he might ask you for some spare change. I'd walked around Oakland all afternoon and the only person who'd spoken to me was a Jehovah's Witness and a Scientologist, both trying to convert me. It felt gross, like being hit on by a pervert.

He had worked his way through the four beers in the fridge over the course of an hour and had started in on the pure ethanol he and Lyle used as a solvent. You couldn't drink it straight of course, unless you wanted to dissolve your taste buds, but it went nicely with orange juice.
When Johnny drank, he had something of a nasty tendency to do so alone. This tendency was nasty only in a social sense, of course. Johnny was by no means an alcoholic, nor was he a violent or melancholy drunk. It just so happened that in early twenty-first century North America, the entire society was fostering the illusion that ethanol was not a drug. Johnny however had no delusions concerning his status as a user of drugs.
As it happened Johnny wasn't truly drinking alone that night. Well, he was alone in drinking, but not in the apartment. A mere four metres away Johnny's roommate and business partner, Lyle, was going through the following emotional states in rapid succession: confusion, concern, fear, anger.
"Johnny!"
"Hmm?"
"JOHNNY!"
"Yeah? I'm listening, whaddya want?"
"Johhny! Look at me!"
"Dude! I'm watching a fucking movie."
At this point Lyle stepped in front of Johnny and turned the TV off.
"What the fuck?"
"Johnny, where did the acid that was on my dresser go?"
"I sold it. Isn't that the fucking point? Maybe I've been wrong about this whole process from the start, but aren't we trying to make money here? If you want me to stop selling the fucking drugs, you should tell me now so I can go back to watching my fucking movie."
Johnny and Lyle were actually very good friends and usually interacted with one another in only the most polite and cordial manner. Johnny however, was more than a little drunk; and Lyle-- Well, Lyle knew something of great import that Johnny did not. But that was about to change.

   Lyle and Johnny had met in Intro to Psych. Neither of them completed the course. Johnny was taking it because he was in first year and still believed that University life was about becoming an educated person rather than about getting in, getting out and getting paid. As such he had signed up for Intro to Psych and Intro to Advanced Physics as the two first year electives in his Computer Science Degree rather than the much more traditional Intro to Logic (which anyone who knows the difference between if and iff can ace) and Science and Society (which gets you your humanities requirement without having to actually take a humanities courses). Lyle's reasons for being in the course were much more mysterious. Johnny noticed him straight off: The punker with the green mohawk sitting just to the left of centre in Convocation Hall, where PSY 100 was held. It was a 9am Monday morning class, the first university class in the lives of most of the students. Yet Lyle did not have the same air of trepidation about him that hovered over the rest of those in attendance. He sat calmly with his Docs up on the back of the seat in front of him, knitting. Whereas almost everyone else in the hall (Johnny included, he was embarrassed to later recall) had brought with them a shiny new binder bought at Wal-Mart (or Grand and Toy for the rich kids) and a pencil case with not only pencils and erasers but pens in blue, black and red, Lyle had three sheets of folded paper which had clearly been pulled from his pockets minutes earlier and a red Bic pen without a cap sitting on his fold-down desk.
The instructor was a frightened looking graduate student named Mohammed Haj-Mosawi who spoke English with a very thick accent and did so in a voice that would have been rather too quiet for polite dinner conversation, never mind lecturing to 800 students. He did however, come armed with some pretty serious PowerPoint slides.

   Johnny woke up to the sound of typing. His first thought was the same as his first thought every morning: "Where am I?" In my room, good. Now who's typing on my computer? The events of the previous night replayed quickly in his mind. Tinka. He opened his eyes: "Whatcha doing?"
She was sitting naked at his desk, the second bottle of wine half-empty between her knees: "Reading your Internet history files."
Like a shot, Johnny was bolt upright in his bed: "What?!"
"Don't get your panties in a bunch," Tinka laughed, "Best way in the world to get to know someone, saves us a lot of trouble. You shouldn't talk about drugs on MSN though, and you certainly shouldn't track your drug-dealing profits in a spreadsheet."
Defensive now, Johnny said: "It's not like I labeled the columns Cocaine and Marijuana."
"Yeah, but what else could it possibly be. Four hundred units at two dollars fifty purchased. Thirty-one units overhead. Three hundred and sixty nine units at five dollars sold. Eight hundred and forty-five dollars gross profits. Good luck convincing a judge you're talking about magazine subscriptions."
"Listen," Johnny said, "I know what I'm doing."
He picked up his pants from the floor and retrieved his cell phone from the pocket, "If I call the phone number for this room..." He did so as he was talking and the phone on the desk started ringing. Tinka reached for it automatically but Johnny stopped her: "Don't answer it"
The phone rang three times and then an answering machine picked up. "I'm not here. You know what to do." said Johnny's voice.
"You hear that?" Johnny said, "That's the computer. The computer answers the land-line and takes messages like an ordinary answering machine, but if I enter an access code," he punched fifteen digits into the keypad of his cell-phone and the computer emitted a single DING, "I get remote access to a special command mode. From this point I can wipe out every file on my hard disk by pressing three buttons." He pressed three buttons and Tinka's eyebrows shot up.
"Those weren't them," Johnny said with a laugh, "that was the exit code."

   Johnny was too curious not to show up. He arrived at Annesley Hall at five minutes to seven in the nicest outfit he owned: a slick black three piece suit with a cobalt blue high necked shirt and no tie. He had bought it for his high school formal-- with drug money. Tinka was waiting for him on the stairs. He didn't recognize her at first, but when he did it almost bowled him over. She had transformed from an intimidating Asian punker girl into the most beautiful woman he had ever seen by simply putting on a dress and a hat.
The dress was a long form fitting red silk evening gown with red sequins and the hat was black and feathered and pinned into her hair, which looked downright aristocratic despite the fact that it peeked out wildly in red, black and blue around the edges. She also wore a black mink scarf that would have looked absurd on anyone but her.
Johnny was just about to tell her that she looked amazing, but she beat him to the punch: "Good Evening Dr. Page, you're looking sharp tonight."
"Sorry?" was the only thing Johnny could think of to say.
"You are Dr. Edward Emmanuel Page and I am your wife Bettie," she replied, checking her makeup in a compact mirror.
"Bettie Page?"
"Only by marriage, now come on." She shoved the mirror back into her purse and led him into the building. They ascended the stairs toward the main hall.
"Nice dress," Johnny said from two stairs behind and below Tinka.
"Thanks. Stole it from a costume rental shop." As she said this, Tinka turned and made eye contact with Johnny. It was then that he noticed that her eyes were just as wild and fiery as they had been the day before. It made her look less like a respectable aristocratic lady and rather quite a bit more like a walking time bomb in an evening gown.

   That evening Johnny was in his 8pm calculus tutorial when his cell phone began to vibrate in his pants. Surreptitiously leaving the room he checked the call display: 'number blocked'.
"Hello?" Johnny answered the phone as he leaned up against the wall outside the men's room.
"Johnny!" the voice at the other end called out excitedly against the too loud music in the background, "It's good to hear your voice man!"
"Who is this?" Johnny asked, his paranoid streak urging him to hang up immediately.
"I'm hurt Johnny. Really, I'm hurt. It's Ivan, you little son of a bitch! Oh such a sad thing that I should be forgotten so soon. Put your evil ways behind you have you? Livin' the straight life now? No time for your old ne'er-do-well friends?"
Johnny was surprised despite himself. "Ivan," Johnny said with real happiness in his voice, "I was just going to call you myself."
"From you Johnny, I'd almost believe it. Doesn't matter though, only one thing matters now: I'm at the Beagle and while I might be able to finish this pitcher by myself, I certainly can't manage the other one I just ordered without a little help."
"The Beagle?" Johnny asked.
"Yeah. Jeez kid, don't you live here? Get with the times. The Regal Beagle, Bloor and Huron. Should I expect you in five or do I have to make this here waitress drink with me? She's cute, you might like her... yeah love, you'll like him too. Scrappy little skater kid, little on the short side maybe but he--"
"Alright Ivan, for fuck's sake," Johnny cut him off, "I'm on my way!"
The jukebox was playing some hip-hop song Johnny had never heard when he arrived. He spotted Ivan right off. At six foot four he was easy to pick out of the crowd. It also didn't hurt that he had all three on duty waitresses at his table dancing and singing along to the chorus with him.

   Johnny awoke to the most utter blackness he could remember experiencing. There is a tiny claustrophobe hiding inside of every person and the one in Johnny was threatening to start pumping his lungs. Quickly he reached behind his head to where he vaguely remembered there being a lamp. After a few seconds of fumbling he managed to turn it on.
The room burst into light. Sitting up, he took in his surroundings. At least that much of what he remembered from the previous night seemed to correspond to reality. Night? The sun had still been high when Tinka had found him. He could only have been four or five hours into his trip. There is no way he should have been able to sleep. "Here. Swallow this," his memory provided. A pill! Had he been poisoned? He patted his chest and stomach with both hands as though that would give him a clue. No, it suddenly occurred to him; not poisoned, sedated. Remembering a clock, he looked up. To its face there was affixed a note:
Johnny, be gone by dawn. Take the note with you. -Tinka
Detaching the note from the face of the clock, Johnny learnt that it was three o'clock (in the morning he could only assume). Johnny looked again at the picture next to the clock and in a moment of uncharacteristic jealousy wanted to leave the note behind so that the man in the picture might find it. This urge passed and he gathered his skateboard from the floor and his binder from what passed for a desk. He looked around once more before leaving and resisted the temptation to rifle through Tinka's things. He pushed open the door and was surprised to find that it did in fact open up onto an extremely narrow passage with an identical doorway proclaiming 1959 directly across the way.

   Spring comes late in Maine. Snow changes to rain; branch tips redden; you can see your breath. Not a whole lot different than winter until the daffodils, crab apples, and forsythia bloom. The sun skips off the water, impossibly bright, impossibly blue. You can almost almost hear the cracking of seeds, buried and forgotten.
Charlie Garrett was as hardnosed as most. He kept going, did what he had to. "Ninety percent of success is showing up," Woody Allen said. Charlie repeated that in dire times--before medical checkups or visits to his brother, Orson.
Orson knew a lot about success and never hesitated to pass it on. "What you need, Charlie, is a Cessna. You aren't supposed to spin them, but you can. That'll clear your head, Charlie, straight down, counting as a barn comes around--one time, two times, three times--correct and pull out nice and easy." Orson dipped his knees, lowering his flattened palm. Or a catboat: "A solid little Marshall, Charlie. Putter around, take some cutie coasting. You're in sailor heaven, man, all those islands."
"I know some cuties," Miranda had said.
"Last cutie took my silver garlic press. Well, she didn't take it; she borrowed it and never returned it."
"Call her up and get it back," Orson said.
"That's what she wants you to do." Miranda was the best thing about Orson.
"I got another one."
"Where the hell did you find a silver garlic press?" Orson was impressed.
"It's aluminum, I think, or a composite material."
"Oh."
It was always like that; motion was Orson's answer to everything. Charlie stretched and checked his watch. The ten o'clock ferry from Peaks Island was edging to the dock. Soon a few dozen passengers would walk off the ramp, carrying shopping bags, slipping day packs over one or both shoulders, holding dogs on leashes. Margery, short and polite, would be toward the end of the line, one hand on the railing, blinking as she looked up at the city buildings and around for him.

   I have these pictures--two in fog, two in sun. Fog: a man in a deck chair is playing a trumpet, his feet on the stern railing of a ferry. Fog: a telephone pole seen through a windshield. Sun: a young woman on a bicycle is climbing a cobblestoned street, blonde hair bouncing, white blouse, solid breasts. Sun: a snake falling back to the bank of a stream, a dragonfly in its mouth, dazzling, iridescent.
Put in a certain order, riffled through, they make a silent movie--until sounds grow more insistent. A Jeep honks twice, accelerating past the biker, driver and passenger turning to look. She ignores them. She doesn't notice me watching from a doorway. I suppose my heart leaping toward her made no sound. She was locked into my blood and bone before I knew any words for her, her name even. The shock of recognition left me wide-eyed and strangely blind. Nothing would be seen for itself, only in terms of her--whether she was there or not, how likely it was that she might appear, how not her everything else.
Nantucket is ten miles long with one central town. I worked in a restaurant on the main street. The following day I saw her stop at a bakery/cafe which became my hangout. When she came in again, my throat went dry and my knees shook. I don't remember what I first said to her, but she responded to some sort of signal. She was willing for me to pay more attention. We began to meet in the cafe.
It is hard not to put what I know now into what I knew then. I presented what plumage I had--no money, but a small currency of integrity. I had survived childhood by learning to please. Eventually, I could no longer do that and I started over, was reborn at nineteen. While I was only five, by that count, when Jamie (her name) pedaled up the main street of Nantucket, I was uncompromised; I offered myself for whatever waited inside that white blouse.

   At the sound of wooden blocks struck together, Arthur adjusted his sitting position and emptied his mind. The echo diminished to a memory and changed to a tree. A palm tree. Not this again. An expanse of empty beach curved to a familiar headland. Sometimes his grandmother would appear, coming toward him on her fitness walk, legs moving quickly, scarcely bending at the knees, like the birds that chased and retreated at the water's edge. She never noticed him.
This morning Penn stepped from the water and approached, his long thin body tanned ivory brown, his eyes blue-green, clear as a cat's. Things came easy to Penn. Arthur exhaled the past and inhaled it again. Not that way, he told himself. No struggle. Let it float away. He straightened and followed his breathing. Penn disappeared as casually as he had twenty years ago.
Arthur put his cheek against the palm tree. The bark was like cloth, raspy and flexible, wrapped around and around the heart of the tree. Someday, years of balmy weather would be violently interrupted. This tree, which grew in sand, would have to bend horizontal or be uprooted.
Arthur exhaled the satisfaction that attended this insight. No attachment.
When the blocks sounded again, he stood and walked with the others around the zendo, careful not to look at Martin for approval. He wasn't sure why Martin was hard on him. Martin was enlightened, but wisdom hadn't erased narrow lines in his face, resentful lines. Arthur was respected in the scientific community, well paid. Martin had been an insurance adjuster or something before he found his vocation. He had shaved his head, but the cheap haircut remained.
The blocks signalled and sitting resumed, the group settling into a shared breathing. A quiet euphoria rose and faded, replaced by an edgy pre-verbal clarity. Kwok! Over. Arthur rejoined the world of choice and demand. He felt that he was making progress.

   It dawned hot in Georgia. Don rubbed his head and blinked. He got out of bed and paused before a makeshift easel where a drawing, taped to a board, showed a woman sitting on a park bench. She was large, dressed in layers of multi-colored cotton. She reminded him of the Renoir woman in her plush living room, the dog sprawled at her feet, but she was smarter. The line across her eyebrows and tapering along her jaw was right. He'd left out a lot, but that didn't matter. If what was there was true enough, you knew the rest--like a Michelangelo shoulder emerging from stone.
He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face.
After coffee and a piece of toast, he rolled the drawing and took it to the park where the woman fed pigeons every day. She wasn't there. She wasn't there the next day, either. The following day Don brought a loaf of bread, sat on her bench, and tossed white pellets into the air. Birds fought for each piece. He prepared the remaining bread and scattered it in one throw. "There you go--something for everybody. She'll be back soon."
A week later, she showed up. Don moved aside and asked, "Where you been?"
"Took sick."
"I've been feeding the pigeons."
"I was worrying. Thank you."
"I did a drawing of you. I wanted to name it, but--I didn't know your name."
"Ruby."
"Ruby, ah. I'm Don. You want to see it? I'll bring it tomorrow."
"Sure."
"O.K. How you feeling?"
"Better, now."
"Good." He walked to his usual bench and sat down. The sun beat on the live oak trees and sage-green strings of Spanish moss while the birds made happy sounds in front of Ruby. She had lost weight, he thought, but it was hard to tell, the way she dressed. She was a beauty once. He remembered his bloodshot eyes in the bathroom mirror. None of us getting any younger. He would give her the drawing in the morning and take off. It was time to leave Savannah, past time. Head for Portland again. Look up Lorna.

   Cat woke in darkness. Something had changed. Something was new and different and strange.
She glanced at the window. The stars were bright above the streetlights. A raven flew away from the sill with a soft fluttering. That wasn't what woke her. Ravens often perched on the tower of Casa Medianoche.
She sat up, shivering as the blanket slid from her shoulders. The shadows in her room were familiar. The high posts of the old Spanish bed that had been her mother's had never frightened her--when she was little, her father had said they were guards named John, Paul, George, and Ringo who would protect her from any closet monster. The antique wardrobe was big enough to hide serial killers, but only if they threw out half her collection of old costumes and games. The hulking shape in the far corner was the ancient desk that had been her mother's, now topped with a computer that had been her father's. The squatting shape in the near corner was a Victorian armchair, piled with clothes and school books. Two black blurs like monstrous eyes were the doors to the stairs and the elevator. They always groaned when they opened. She would have heard anyone using them.
The only difference in her room was barely a difference. On the far side of the bed, her best friend was sleeping soundly. Tarika often slept over. Tarika wasn't what had changed.
Cat listened to the night. A few cars passed in the distance. A breeze rustled a palo verde tree. The city of Tucson was quiet.
She sniffed. The air was crisp and dry, just as it was every autumn.
The mattress shifted as Tarika lifted her head from the pillow to mumble, "Cat? Wegoddagiddupaready?"
The clock's glowing numbers said they had an hour until sunrise. "No. Stay asleep, Tee."
Tarika nodded. "Gub." Her head dropped into the pillow. "Yootoo."
Cat pulled her blanket around her shoulders. It was nice having someone warm beside her. She wished she had a cat or a dog to snuggle on cool mornings.

   As Cat passed her father's study., he looked up from a thick book and said, "Terrifying costume, kid."
She wore a boy's black suit, a white shirt, a blue tie, and dark sunglasses, all from Goodwill. She nodded and almost kept walking. The memory of pancakes made her pause. "It's a not-a-costume."
"Oh?"
"Mr. Killjoy banned costumes at school. He says they're for children."
"So you're not a bill collector? That's a relief." "I'm displaying my maturity by dressing like a productive citizen." "Because you're really a secret agent?" "I'm sorry." Cat reached into her pocket. "I must kill you now." She drew a water pistol, grinned, and aimed at him in a perfect two-handed grip.
He threw his arms over his book. "Kid! If this got wet--"
She felt her grin die. What could she say? That, for a moment, she had thought he was an ordinary father and she was an ordinary daughter, and they were having an ordinary moment of fun? She put the water gun back in her pocket. "I wouldn't have squirted you," she lied.
He watched her as if he wanted to say something. He would never admit his books were more important than she was. She whirled and raced downstairs, shouting, "Bye, Granny Lupe!" so her father would hear that she didn't say goodbye to him.
Granny Lupe called, "Let me see the not-a-costume!"
Cat ran to the top of the basement stairs and turned like a runway model.
From the shadows below, Granny Lupe said, "Ah. The best bad girls wear men's clothes. I remember a masque where Lucrezia Borgia--"
"I'll be late! Tell me later!" Cat snatched her book bag and ran outside.
The rising sun was just below the Rincon Mountains. Cat thought that if she could paint like Tarika, she would paint Luna Street with its small, southwestern houses in desert colors, burnt red, fire orange, and cactus green, all washed in soft blue light.

   Because they arrived ten minutes late, Cat and Tarika were sent straight to the principal's office. Lovejoy, standing behind the front desk, towered over them, even over Tarika. He wore his usual dark suit, white shirt, and dark tie. He said, "Catalina Medianoche and Tarika Soto. It's always a pleasure to start my day with you two ladies. One week detention hall, starting today, for the Blues Sisters."
Cat said, "Why?" "You know the costume policy." "Are you in a costume?" "Of course not."
"Then we're not."
"Hmm." He stroked his goatee. "Obviously you are, or you wouldn't have been sent here."
Tarika said, "We were sent here because we were late." Lovejoy nodded. "Better and better. Two weeks detention." Tarika said, "Because Cat was nearly run over!" Lovejoy blinked at Cat. "Is this a joke?"
Cat shook her head. "Call the police. We made a 9-1-1."
Lovejoy said, "Wait here," and went in his office. After a minute, he came back and said gently, "Sorry. No detention. You may go back to class." He turned to the mirror and straightened his tie. "After all, can't blame you for wanting to look sharp."
Cat said, "Sir? Did they find the driver?"
"Just the van," Lovejoy replied. "A few blocks from where it was stolen. It must've been a kid on a joyride."
Tarika said, "It was stolen?"
Lovejoy nodded. "Which is not your problem now. Your problem is getting back to class while you still have my sympathy. That's good for another forty-five seconds." He glanced at his watch. "No, thirty-five. No, twenty-five--"
Tarika tugged Cat's wrist. "We're gone."
In the hallt, Cat smiled at Tarika. "I could turn cartwheels all the way to class."
"Because we didn't get detention?" "Because the weird is over. Halloween can be normal now." "Maybe there should be some weird on Halloween." "Yeah. Predictable weird, like people in brilliant costumes, and surprise parties, and new kinds of candy in your trick or treat bag. Good weird. Not bad weird. "

   Tarika's house was like most houses in Tucson's Barrio del Rio: small, stuccoed, with a red tile roof, burnt orange walls, and purple trim around the doors and windows. When Cat rang the bell, a tall skeleton in a dark suit opened the front door and said, "You're late."
"Like that's different." The skeleton said, "On Halloween." "Uncle Olujimi kept telling funny stories about his kids and wives.
He's so nice he likes Evil Dad. Also, something happened." "No talk." Tarika yanked Cat inside. "The maestro must work." "But I've got to tell you about this afternoon!" "Which is why I'll do your hands first." Tarika dragged Cat to her room, a mash-up of Mexico and Africa.
Against one wall were an acoustic guitar, a keyboard, a doumbek, and a hammered dulcimer. One corner of the room was bare so Tarika could dance. One wall had a mural she had painted of her heroes. Muhammad rode a flying horse through the night sky, Jesus walked above a lake during a storm, and Shakira danced in space with the earth, the moon, and the sun behind her. Below the mural was lettered in gold paint, You are a song written by the hands of God.
Cat dropped onto a big pillow on the floor. While Tarika painted finger bones on her skin, Cat told everything she had seen and heard about her trip to Arkan Exterminators. When she finished, she asked, "What do you think?"
"I'm with Granny Lupe. Ms. Arkan's a stalker ex-girlfriend." "And someone stole her van and nearly hit me? Big coincidence." Tarika shrugged. "If there weren't coincidences, there wouldn't be a word for them. Is Ms. Arkan dumb enough to run someone over in a car with her name on the side?"
"Maybe someone wanted to frame her."
"You think your dad could have two stalker girlfriends? Someone reads too much manga."
"Would a stalker show up after fourteen years?" "Why not? Your dad's the hot." "The hot? Evil Dad?" "Totally Heathcliffy."

   I was seventeen, almost eighteen, the first time I killed someone.
It was kind of an accident, in the same way that bubble gum is kind of a food. I hadn't set out to kill him, honestly, but I wasn't exactly trying not to kill him either.
To be fair, the guy was trying to kill me first. That I had most likely broken his arm and nose before he tried to kill me would probably have been brought up by the prosecution at my murder trial, if there had ever been one. If there had been, though, I or my overpriced attorney (I'm assuming that if I had one, he would be overpriced) would have mentioned the extreme duress I was under. My father had recently died, my school life had gone completely out of control, I had more than a little bit of pepper spray in my eyes, and I was acting to defend my life and the life of the girl I was with.
But alas, there was no murder trial. There was hardly an investigation, really. As an average teenager, that night would have probably been the high -- or low -- point of my young, naive life. It would probably have been the topic of discussion in a lifetime of counseling and group therapy. It might have motivated a period of heavy drug use and the abandonment of friends and family, followed by an inspirational recovery that I might later write about in a best-selling autobiography, that would surely be described by Newsweek magazine as, "A haunting, yet uplifting story of tragedy and the re-discovery of life that every person, young and old, must read." My life wouldn't move in that direction, though.
Being put in a situation where you have to decide whether or not to probably kill someone to protect your own life should have affected me profoundly, but it didn't. It bounced off me like rain off glass.
Around two weeks later, when I killed someone again, this time much more deliberately, I was affected even less. There was no murder trial for that one, either.

   One of the very few nice things to come from my father's untimely death was that I was excused from school for practically as long as I wanted.
I was a senior in high school at the time, and although I did well in most classes I loathed the very notion of being inside the building. If I had been just a bit younger during the Attention Deficit Disorder and Ritalin craze that swept the nation a few years ago, I probably would have been swept up in it. They'd say the reason I was so disinterested in classes was that I couldn't focus or that my brain was working harder than most other kids, so I should be put on a neuro-stimulant that single-handedly changed the already-aging idea of a school nurse from an applicator of bandages and thermometers to a dispensary of pre-prescribed medications.
I doubted I suffered from any definitive brain disorder, though. I just didn't like spending all day in a school, being given information and then instantly asked to recall it, and being fed mass-produced chicken nuggets at lunch. The US government, the largest governing body on the planet is tasked with educating its children in everything needed to be successful in adult life, and this is the best they can do? By the end of each day I would always feel exhausted mentally and physically, not from difficult classes but from trying to parse enormous chunks of boredom into pieces small enough to handle without causing an aneurysm. I'd head home each day with the eagerness of a recently paroled inmate and decompress my brain with some television or video games before going to bed way too late and wake up way too early, just to deal with it all again.
I was grateful, then, for the respite from institutionalized learning.

   One week after my net worth increased by something like thirty zillion percent I was back in school, back to reality. To be honest, I was starting to look forward to going back. Somehow, sinking into familiar routines seemed like the most amazing thing I could have done. Sitting around the house or walking around the neighborhood was doing me no good, not with the compounding mysteries seeping into my life.
Monday morning, I walked those halls again and let myself slip into the empty anonymity provided by a crowd of peers. Freshmen with their stupid-huge backpacks, sophomores telling inside jokes so satisfied that they're cooler than at least one group of people, juniors walking with their noses in books and looking distraught over all the stress they're under, and seniors leaning against locker doors, their backpacks long since abandoned and only carrying few things absolutely necessary to get through the day. Life seems so much easier when peer groups are categorized so rigidly.
Anonymity went out the window when I entered my first class and sat down. From the second I walked in the door, hushed conversations were severed as 40 eyes dug into me and trailed me as I slumped into the first empty desk I saw. I darted my eyes around, everybody avoided eye contact. I lined my pencils up on my desktop while the room sat in a still, thick silence.
They had to have heard about my dad's death, but I hoped the word hadn't gotten about regarding my ill-gotten gains. It shouldn't have; I didn't tell anybody. Still, if everybody knows, I'd need to hire a bodyguard just to hold off the ironic requests for loans. I tried to imagine how much bodyguards cost; I remembered reading somewhere that a legitimate executive security firm charges about a thousand dollars per day. I could get a bodyguard for 500 days, and then I wouldn't need one anymore. Spending all your money to keep people from getting your money -- that should have been a Twilight Zone episode.

   At my school, the role of dealing with students typically reserved for a single principal is split up among a small fleet of "administrators" who are assigned to certain students seemingly at random. I understand this is common now among modern high schools. The administrator I was assigned to was Mr. Comstock. Replacing the first 'o' with a 'u' has always been a popular teenage antic around here, and is one of the reasons I loathe admitting that I am, in fact, a teenager.
I'd spoken to Mr. Comstock only a few times in my life, even though it seemed like he'd been around me forever. When I was in elementary school, he worked there in the office somewhere; he transferred to my middle school during my second year there, and he and I started at this high school at the same time. He must either be very easily dissatisfied or so horrible to work for that he just gets slid around the system so nobody has to deal with him for too long.
I'd apparently broken one person's nose and collapsed another's larynx. The kid who'd walked in on the fight, a freshman, had run to the nearest adult, who called the school's assigned police officer. Said police officer arrived on scene just as I was tossing one kid -- the one whose larynx I collapsed -- onto another. When my head stopped thumping and I could stand up, I was taken to this office and left alone. Through the glass panel of the closed, probably locked door I saw paramedics rolling stretchers down the hall.
Mr. Comstock had been on the phone since I got there, talking with various people including the police. After a few minutes of silent contemplation as to the source of the pain in my head, I heard Mr. Comstock begin to wind down the conversation and then he hung up the telephone and looked to me, himself seeming frazzled and anxious to say something. He started to tell me then about the collapsed larynx and broken nose until the phone rang yet again.

   It was only one thirty, but I went right from school to the nearest Starbucks. I would have gone home, but my mom may have been there and I didn't know how to explain that I was done with high school and that life generally sucks without it sounding like mundane teenager issues. I sat in a hard wooden chair in the back of the shop with my back to the wall, my hands spinning a warm cup of espresso, steamed milk, and flavored sugar while my brain ran in circles.
I kept telling myself that I'm overreacting, that I must be manifesting some weird emotions over my dad's death. I hadn't really shown any emotion after it, never screamed at the sky and asked God why bad things happen to good people. I just... dealt with it. People around me were probably wondering why I was so passive about it, afraid I was internalizing it and was going to explode someday. Explode like, collapse a larynx and break a nose.
Maybe that was it. I was just holding it all in, the massive weirdness of the life insurance money had distracted me from my grief and I never noticed it until it broke free and broke the nose of whoever was closest to me. Maybe.
Amy got there around two twenty, sooner than I expected. When she walked in the door she smiled at me, held up an index finger and got in line at the counter. I whistled, and pointed at the iced passion tea lemonade sitting across the tiny round table from me. She held in a laugh and walked over, sitting across from me.
"How gentlemanly," she said.
"That's what you got last time, so it's 'your drink', right?" I asked.
"I guess. I also like the gingerbread latte, but they've probably stopped doing those now that Christmas is just a memory."
"Probably," I said, sipping my gingerbread latte.

   I have been and still is in this situation in my family life. In 2013, I fell severely ill and it took me these 5 years to return to normal life. In all these five years, I haven't had any finanical or moral help from my husband. While I was in excruciating pain, he enjoyed his life to the fullest, splashing out money for his hobbies like fishing. I had to hold two jobs to pay my medical bills since my health policy didn't cover the costs of my treatment. I had to take two- hour breaks between my workshifts ( fortunately, my former boss gave me permission to use a recliner bed in our doctor's office for that) and my “dear other half” complained about having to collect me to and from work as his car was used too often. For those, living in the US, I feel I need to explain some details. In Russia, we don't usually have a joint family bank account, so I couldn't use his money; I had to make do with what I earned. I asked him for money, which I always borrowed from him returning it regularly, only twice in all these years. He gave me a little sum once only to reproach me for asking the next day. He refused to lend me a meager sum for three days though he knew well enough that if I didn't get the medicine I needed, I could pass out in any place and any time. So now, I don't trust him anymore and feel very insecure. If you ask me about how it feels to live like that, I'll tell you that it's devastating. Many people feel betrayed when they are cheated on. I only smile when I read their stories. They don't know what betrayal is and what it means to have to live with a traitor who may let you down any minute.

   It was a Saturday night and I was working the broiler station, responsible for cooking steaks and chops. On any busy night I had to cook a hundred or more steaks to the customer’s specifications (rare to well done).
The kitchen closed at 10:00 and an order came in at 10:10 for a filet mignon, rare. This called for cursing, complaining, and the demand for a cold “heinie” (Heiniken Beer). I cooked the filet (6 oz., bacon wrapped) to rare and sent it out. I resumed my cleaning; I wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant. There had been a function for 150 and I had worked since 8:00 AM, a fourteen hour day. I was a little on the testy side.
The waiter returned with the steak. It was too rare.
“M***** F***** .“ I turned the broiler back and begrudgingly cooked the steak to med- just a little pink in the center.
In two or three minutes the waiter returned with the steak. Still too rare. I am now pissed off. Apparently this yahoo has no idea of what a rare steak looks like. I butterfly the sucker and cook it into a state of unmistakable well-doneness. I glare at the waiter. Not his fault but I have lost any reasonableness I might have possessed. “86!” I yell. Close the kitchen down.
The waiter returns yet again. Still too rare. I am now Samuel L. Jackson incarnate. I take the steak and throw it into a frialator, a deep fat fryer at 375 degrees, and leave it in the hot fat for five minutes. The steak now looks like a deformed hockey puck, it has become a shriveled up piece of charred animal flesh.
The kitchen staff gather around, eager to see how this last move will play out.
The waiter returns with a big smile. “Compliments to the chef.”

    What is the most salacious thing that you’ve seen in public?

   Depends on how you define "public"….
The trails around the stable where I used to board my horse went through a very up-scale housing development. The back yards of the houses abutted the trail; they had cinder-block walls that were a good 8 feet high.
….So if you were in one of the yards, you couldn't see over the fence or through the fence; if you were walking on the trail, you had 8-foot block walls on either side of you, and you couldn't see over or through the walls into the yards.
But if you were riding a horse, you could see over the top of the walls into the back yards of the houses.
Some of the trails in the development weren't used by equestrians very often. I liked to use these trails, which were quieter than the more-travelled trails. Because many of the residents of the development weren't too happy about having horses close at hand (objections to dust, flies and noise), when we went through the development, we usually went at a very quiet walk.
So I was riding my horse down this trail one afternoon, heading back to the stable after a longer trail ride. It was a quiet afternoon, and as I headed through the development, I heard a kind of creak-creak-creak sound.
It was unusual enough that I started scanning over the fences, into the yards, trying to figure out what it was.
As I came around a slight curve in the trail, I found the source of the noise.
There was one of those big, round, elevated trampolines in the back yard. And on the trampoline were a naked man and woman, bouncing gently up and down as they engaged in a VERY intimate activity! Creak-creak-creak…
They saw me at about the same time I saw them. I saluted them with my riding crop, kicked my horse into a canter, and scrammed the hell out of there; I have no idea what they did after I left!

   We were married in a judge’s office. The instant we were married, I felt regret like a curtain closing. I knew something was wrong. I had ignored that inner voice that had been telling me GET AWAY!
We were married on a Tuesday. Three days later (Friday), I consulted a lawyer for an annulment, because I had discovered that my new wife had no attraction for me. None whatsoever. She didn’t believe in premarital sex, so I didn’t know what I was getting into until we married.
I blame only myself for the mistake, because I ignored the very strong gut instinct that warned me not to get married. The experience taught me to listen to that inner voice. I’ve listened to it ever since that day in the judge’s office those many years ago. I don’t blame my wife at all. It was my mistake and much of our unhappiness was my fault.
We ended up staying together for six weeks. It was like six weeks of Navy SEALs training in emotional suffering for both of us! I can laugh about it now. Hell, Marine Corps boot camp would be child’s play compared to what we went through in mental stress.
Many years later a close friend told me that my wife, during that six weeks of marriage, approached him about having an affair with him. He asked, “What about _____?” (Insert my name, which will remain anonymous here.) She said, “What about him?”
Think twice, three times, a hundred times before getting married. Listen to your intuition. Sleep on it. Be especially careful around the potential partner who is “perfect,” because that may be a sign that something is wrong. Be with the perfect partner long enough to see how they act when things go wrong. How does that person treat waiters in a restaurant?
Just be careful. But at the same time, stay open minded. You don’t want to reject the love of your life, either.

   when I was 16 I got a girlfriend. Her name is Lisa. We had really good relationship. One day she came to me and said I’m moving to Florida, I said “ ok ,but can you promise me something?” she nod her head. “ Can you you please wait for me until I come to Florida, I promise it won’t take long so please wait for me ok” then she started to cry and said yes I’ll wait for you even if it take years while hugging me. The day after that i ask my parents if I can move to Florida. They told me to wait till I graduate. I just told them it’s gonna take long until I graduate. Just like that I got into a big fight with my parents and finally I got to leave to Florida on my own. Even thought my parents don’t like it I just didn’t listen to them. I think It took me about two month until i met Lisa again. I was shocked when I saw her with a guy but then i thought no he maybe her friend. “hey Lisa I’m back I missed you so much how you doing?” I ask about to hug her, but she back off and said “hey Chris long time no see I’m doing great and what about you?” “I’m good btw who is that guy?” i ask her while looking at that guy. And she hold his hand and said “ He is my boyfriend Jack” I don’t know what happend to her while she was in Florida but she has change a lot. I just gave her a weak smile and want back to my apartment. I look at myself in the mirror and thought why did I even trusted her. Because of her I made my parents hate me.I decided to go back and apologies to my parents. Just like that i want back apologies to my parents. Thankfully my lovely parents forgive me. I regret so much to trust her but now I’m fine =)

   Yes, it was a very long time ago. I was 17 and at my best friends house. There were about seven girls there. All were friends, some closer than others. One girl had been alternating between yelling at her boyfriend on the phone and sobbing. It was like 2 in the morning. Everyone else seemed to be very concerned about her. I thought she was being quite mean to him, demanding attention and just being completely irrational.
i was tired and I wanted to go to sleep. After this had dragged on and on, I think I said something pretty awful like you are being a bitch, just go to sleep.
She turned on me and said you will never understand what I’m going through, you don’t know how to love anyone. The only person you love is your younger brother.
No one stood up for me.
And it was true, I didn’t date much. I did but I never got very involved. I stayed pretty distant. I had my reasons for this that I didn’t understand at the time. But I just knew she hit on something that was true in a sense but not in the way she meant it.
And because I didn’t understand it, I thought she might be right. I didn’t know how to explain myself and I wasn’t the kind of person to demand attention like she was. It hurt my deeply but I didn’t say anything and I had no idea what to do with that hurt.
And the fact that none of my friends said anything made me feel so very alone. I wish I could go back now as a mother and explain a little to that girl, help her along but I guess she did finally find her way.

    What is the saddest thing your parent(s) have ever told you?

   It wasn’t told to me, but instead my mother was furious with my father and his family. I have never forgotten her words to him.
His youngest sister, an aunt I had never met although she lived in the same city, drowned herself and her two young sons in Lake Michigan. I was maybe 5 or 6 at the time, I think? That would make this around 1956 or 1957.
My father and his 5 remaining siblings sprang for a really expensive funeral. The figure that sticks in my mind is $5,000.
Understand that $8K could have bought an entire house in Chicago; a nice 3–4 bdrm red brick home on a good-sized lot, at the time. As Niseis they experienced a great deal of prejudice after WWII, so an annual salary of $2K would be doing really well.
My aunt’s husband had died unexpectedly young. He had no insurance and almost no savings. She was struggling with two young kids. She reluctantly asked her sisters and brothers for help.
They turned her down. All of them. They had always been a competitive and dysfunctional family, and for whatever reason, they refused to assist her. They told her to go on welfare if she needed money.
In those days welfare had an enormous social stigma. Being Asian and second generation, “losing face” within the local community was utterly humiliating. Your family were quite literally outcast.
Depressed and in despair, she committed suicide.
My mother’s words to my father right after the funeral were to the effect of:
“What use to her is spending $5,000 on a casket and flowers now? If all of you were willing to spend that money, why didn’t you give it to her when she was alive and needed it?”
The answer, of course, is that the $5K funeral was for show - meant only to impress others.
In that one moment, I understood the utter hypocrisy of what had happened. And I never really respected my father’s family ever again.

   I’ve been single a fair amount of my recent adult life and have gone on a lot of dates, so I have a few weird first date stories.
One that’s just a stand out for me happened just about a year ago. We chatted online and seemed to hit it off, we took it to the phone and it seemed alright. He suggested we meet for coffee that same evening and the timing worked for me.
We met at a coffee shop, I had tea and paid for my own, I offered to buy his, but he wanted nothing - he suspiciously eyed the free water in the self service jug, but decided to skip that too.
We grabbed a seat and I asked him about where he lived - he lived about 30 minutes out of the city in a gorgeous tiny town at the foothills of the nearby mountain range. He said he’d lived in the city, but preferred the peace and quiet…(all good so far)…because out there you could get a clear view of the stars…(awww, how lovely)…and the chem trails…(WTF???) “The Chem Trails…you mean the vapour that planes leave when they fly overhead?” I said, hoping I’d misheard him. No, Chem Trails. "The government is trying to poison us.” he said confidently. I asked why they would try to eliminate us indiscriminately, being that we pay taxes and all and there wouldn’t be much money in the coffers if we were all dead, but he was quite insistent. Then he explained that the “Media” was part of the conspiracy, of course, because they knew and kept it from us. I said “well that’s awkward for me, because I work in the media.”
Honestly, that didn’t seem to put him off at all, he just wanted to share more of his theories with me.
Truth be told, I was fascinated and probably egged him on by asking lots of questions, but for goodness sake, part of my job is to interview people - how could I resist?

   Going anonymous for legal reasons.
I used to work at a pharmacy when I was in high school. When I got hired, I was a good student and a really good kid. Over time, though, I started getting involved in some not-so-good stuff. I starting drinking a lot and even started getting into drugs, namely marijuana. Being surrounded by prescription drugs didn’t really bother me because they weren’t the drugs that I was into. At least not at first…
But one day, I was packing up some oxycodone for a patient. This patient was a “frequent flyer” so to speak, always in getting tons of medications. Well this particular prescription was for 300 oxy. 300! There were so many that the lid barely fit. So after thinking about it for a second, my idiot self decided to take a few out. Cause she wouldn’t notice anyway, and I had started to get curious about what the big deal was with them since a lot of people I knew were getting into them. So I stole some.
I committed a felony. Stealing class ii drugs from a patient who needed them. That’s the stuff people go to prison for. If I would have been caught, I would have lost my job, gone to prison, and disowned by my family. It probably would have been in the local news because an in-home healthcare worker had just been in the news for the same thing not long before. I was so stupid and it’s still something that I am so disappointed in myself for doing. Shortly after that, I quit my job. I knew that once I opened up that can of worms, it was going to be really hard to go back. The temptation was too high. And it was totally not worth the risk.

   My friend who used to be a policeman got called to a house for a sudden death. When he got there, what had happened was the father of a wheelchair-bound girl with severe learning difficulties had died of a heart attack, riding a strap on dildo that he had fitted to the poor girl in the wheelchair. He was pegging and pegged it!
Edit: Just to clarify - father strapped a dildo to daughter who was in a wheelchair, climbed on her lap in the wheelchair and rode the dildo, before succumbing to a heart attack on her lap. She was unable to get him off of her lap, and that is what was found by police. She was an unwilling participant.
He also went to another report of a sudden death (why these things kept happening to Rob is beyond me!) where the son of an old gent lived across the country and couldn’t get hold of his dad. He had called the neighbours and they couldn’t get a reply at the door, either.
Rob knocked very loudly and in the end, kicked the door in. The place didn’t smell very good, so Rob had that sinking feeling. He went room to room, searching for the deceased male. Finally, he went to the bedroom and standing at the foot of the bed, he saw the old gent laying there, cheeks sunken in, head back, mouth gaping open. Just to be certain, Rob put his hand under the duvet and touched the deceased’s leg - it was cold and stiff. He goes to his radio and starts to inform the dispatch when suddenly…
The old boy sits up and shouts at him “What are you doing in my house?”
Rob admits, he screamed! The old gent obviously wasn’t dead. It turns out, the batteries in his hearing aids had run down, so he couldn’t hear the phone when his son had called him, nor could he hear the knocking at the front door. And the cold stiff leg? The guy had a prosthetic limb!

   Absinthe and Buckfast. If you don’t know what either of those are then consider yourself lucky. Neither tastes great on their own, and mixed together this was as foul smelling and tasting as they come. Pretty stupid of us to mix them together as well as both are known to get you extremely drunk!
We were at a music festival (Leeds) about 12/13 years ago. A friend had half a bottle of Buckfast left and I had half a bottle of Absinthe left. We mixed them together and egged each other on to drink till it was finished. Both of us were a mess, and I have no clue what happened to him that night.
I realised how drunk I was and staggered towards a bar to ask for some water. Someone was dancing “at” me and refused to get out of the way. I think he thought it was amusing how drunk I was. I was having none of it and ended up throwing up on him before putting my hand on his face and pushing him out of the way. Not intentional, but he really should have read the situation better. I apologised and staggered on.
I got to the bar and asked for water. They were charging about £3 a bottle but then looked at me and just gave me it for nothing. Thanks anonymous bar person!
I got back to my tent and crashed out in a drunken mess. Woke with the worst hangover I’ve ever suffered through, got myself rehydrated, fed and then went to watch some bands the next day.
Not my proudest moment, not the most sensible mixture, not something I would recommend, and not something I would ever be stupid enough to repeat. Oh and my friend had a similar experience minus throwing up on someone. we both lived to tell the tale - barely!

    What's the most ridiculous thing that happened in your highschool?

   Everything that happens in my school is ridiculous, but this one takes the cake… literally.
We had this one teacher, who was literally Satan in the body of a… healthy middle aged man.
By healthy, I mean morbidly obese.
Nothing against morbidly obese people, but this man was craaaaaazzzzyyy!
He would EAT our lunches if we misbehaved, so that we poor students would STARVE.
You would have to be heartless to do that.
But one thing he did to me, triggered me to no extent.
One day, I was sitting in his class, minding my business, when he walked by and looked into my notes.
Now, I had lent my pencil to someone else, who lost it. It’s not like I carry TWO pencils to school. Pffftttt…. that’s ridiculous. What am I…10?
So since that dude had lost the only pencil i had, I didn't have a pencil to write notes with. So i didn't.
Mind you, I had cake for lunch that day, and no way in hell would I have allowed him to touch my lunch.
As soon as his fat, stubby, hairy fingers reached out to my lunch bag, I bit his hand.
Now, I admit it was a little… ‘animal-like’ of me , but come on!
I wasn't going to sit still while some 40 year old dude ate my cake.
Guess what? I got detention, and he went Scott free.
Literally, that creep would measure girls’s skirts to ensure they didn't break the school law, and would ‘accidentally’ peek up their skirts!
There was no action taken against him, despite THOUSANDS of complains.
I still scoff at how ridiculous my school is.
*banging my head on the wall, and cringing at the sheer ridiculousness*
(sorry for the excessive use of the word ‘literally’. What can I say? I’m a teenager.)

   I got a full body massage in Phuket…need I say more? My massage went like this…
I was asked to undress to my knickers and lay face down, on my stomach.
The masseuse began by crawling on me like a tigress, seeking out its prey, starting at my feet then continuing slowly along my legs and finally onto my back. My legs suddenly felt so long with this slow dragging movement. This probably lasted a shorter amount of time than it felt. It was rather strange, having someone on top of you, moving in this manner. Although it was rather enjoyable, I thank God she wasn’t heavy or I would have been crushed.
She proceeded by doing the usual standard massage, followed by the strangest butt massage. My butt was kneaded, and squeezed as if it were a dough ball. Then began the clapping and tapping motion. A rather difficult motion to describe in words.
I then turned over and she took a giant leap, pushing her tiny arms into my pelvis with intense pressure, with the quickest and sturdiest of movements. It was so unexpected that I found it difficult to contain my laughter. It was the strangest feeling in the world! I thought, “Did I order the standard full-body massage? Did she get the memo? This lasted a couple of rather loooong seconds.
Then came the even stranger breast massage. It was NOT a subtle breast massage. It was full-on, breasts over floweth in hand. They were cupped, squeezed, and kneaded. Finally, I couldn’t help but yelp in a fit of laughter and she did too. If this was the standard “full-body massage”, I imagined, what more could there be? All in all, I must say I rather enjoyed it.
Wow, thank you all for the Upvotes. I will be sure to try all the other massages they offer me next time. If anything, it’s worth the laugh!

    Have you ever been stalked by an ex?

   Yes and for me it was much easier to deal with then the man who’s been stalking me for the last five years that I don’t really know.
Four different times I have been stalked by ex’s. Only one was based more in a sort of revenge mode. He wanted to get back together so he could dump me. He called obsessively, showed up where he knew I would be and harassed my friends for information. I’m sad to say I actually did go back out with him and he did break up with me but that wasn’t the end. He thought he had left me a crumpled mess only to find out I was fine and had moved on.
So he started his stalking all over again. However, everyone knew what he was up too. What I didn’t expect was then he turned to vandalizing and bad mouthing me to anyone that would listen. It was so bizarre!
Believe it or not but I ended up taking him back in hopes he would just stop being so crazy. He didn’t and he got worse with me becoming physically violent and then he cheated on me.
I broke it off again and even though he started dating the girl he cheated on me with he still couldn’t let me go. It took four years and my then fiancé now husband to tell him to get lost.
It’s strange though if I had to choose I would take dealing with an ex that is now stalking me over the man I don’t really know. An ex you have history and you know their friends and family. You know if the police would have an effect or talking to their parents. With a stranger you don’t know any of those things and you don’t know what they are capable of. I don’t think anyone really wants either but since I’ve dealt with both I thought I’d share that.

   Yesterday I got home from work, threw my bag on my table, looked up and saw a whopper of a spider on my wall. Let’s be clear, it was a whopper by China standards and not by Australian outback standards. In size, it was about the circumference of a pint glass.
I took a deep breath, grabbed a Tupperware box and text book, and with an admirable sense of courage, I said to the spider, “别害怕，我帮你!” (Don’t be scared, I’ll help you). I had to use Chinese, otherwise it wouldn’t have understood me.
I managed to trap the spider in the Tupperware against the wall and shuffle the text book underneath, delicately avoiding ripping it’s little legs off. I walked outside, past the gawps of neighbours in the corridor and past the trash pile next to the door that smells like a freshly dug up, mass grave.
As I opened my innovative contraption and carefully placed the spider on a path to freedom, I did a mini jump, threw my arms in the air and even let out a little, “Yay, spider!”
Almost immediately, my landlord’s over excited Staffordshire bull terrier (the Chinese version) sprinted out of absolutely nowhere and mauled my spider friend to death. When I say mauled, there was absolutely no trace of the spider after the dog had had his 1.8 seconds of fun. My landlord’s Father, affectionately named ‘Uncle Li’ by the local residents, shuffled up to the area where the spider would have been with his vest on and a giant wooden bong in his hand, looked at me, and giggled.
I forgot about the spider immediately because Uncle Li was making fish with garlic and chili and he offered me some.
I tried my best, pal.

   Umm…I think this broke my daughter.
My youngest brother has always had an affinity for unusual pets—Snakes, tarantulas, big toothy lizards. You name it and he’s probably handled it. In fact, he still volunteers at an exotic animal shelter which is home to a large variety of those aforementioned creatures, and my old friend White Noise.
Many years ago, I went to visit my mother where he still lived, off and on, as it was closer to his job than his new apartment. I happened to go into his room and noticed a gold foil topped box about four or five inches square. Nosey as I am, I had to open it.
It contained the shed exoskeleton of a large hairy yellow and black tarantula. Creepy as that was, it didn’t bother, or even surprise me much, as I knew my brother might keep something like that in his room.
About an hour later, he called to say hello and suggested I take a look at the gold box in his room. I told him that I already had, but I picked it up again to take another look, while he told me about watching his pet shed it.
My two year old daughter was VERY curious about the contents of the pretty box, so I showed it to her.
Big BAD mistake. A mistake so bad it should have been spanked.
She took one look at it, turned white and visibly trembled. I’ve never seen someone so terrified.
Of course I did what I could to reassure her. I explained that it was the big spiders “old body” and that it actually lived at her uncles other house.
But, umm. . .I guess I wasn’t really much of a compassionate and understanding dad, because over the next couple years I teased her with a jumping toy spider, a gummy tarantula and “creepy fingers up the arm.”

   Not to me, but my grandma.
Last year, she accidentally broke her arm, we took her to the EM, where they told us she needs to do a surgery immediately. They kept asking us some questions about her. But the surgery was canceled due to old age. They told us that she would live on painkillers until her arm heals, but she may not be able to use it as before due to the untreated damage. She will also stay in the hospital until she be fine. The broken part was swelling every day until it becomes so noticeable to the doctor !! The doctor decided to make a small surgery to the swelling part and empty it. They also tested the fluid and the results says that the fluid is dead-white blood cells. This means that it got a microbe, so they gave her some antibiotics. It becomes full of fluids again and again. One doctor told us that it shouldn't be opened from the first place, not even to test the fluid. However, one day her blood pressure was very low(the doctors told us later it's due to her arm's infection and the meds), but they didn't notice it, nor measure it. They noticed a bed wounds, an increase in body fluids or something like that on her body, so they gave her Lasix (Furosemide). Lasix is a good choice in this situations, but not with low blood pressure's people !! Two hours later, We received a call from the hospital telling us that she passed out due to very low blood pressure. We were in a complete shook that she was very normal in the day before, but now they're telling us that she actually died. R.I.P grandma.
P.S.: it was one of the big hospitals in the city and very expensive too.
The swelling part of the arm.

   This “casual” email was sent to me just over 9 months after my discard. (He ended it 11 days before my birthday and two months before our wedding day.)
I was very close with his family. Remembered every birthday, anniversary, holiday etc… His parents had their own guest bedroom in our house as well… I never responded to this disgusting, lame email, but did receive a beautiful (but sad) card from his grandmother about how heartbroken she was for me.
To me, this email just shows more of his lying character. This man destroyed me, so this blasé correspondence was insulting and detrimental to my psyche. My discard included him packing all of my things for me, putting them in a huge pile in our garage and letting me come pick everything up. Within two weeks after discard, I was blocked on all social media and he then texted me to let me know he started dating again. I was also never given a reason for him discarding me other than I “didn’t do anything wrong” “there was nothing [I] could do to fix it.” he “didn’t want to work on anything.” he “just wanted to be single” … after buying a house, planning a wedding, adopting animals together, and me literally changing my life around to make him happy… He used silent treatment and abandonment to the max to do the most damage. And he was successful.
*I will add that this one email broke my heart all over again at the time. I was nowhere near functional and seeing/getting this pushed me waaaay back in any allusion I had about being “okay”. Three months later I was put on medical leave for cPTSD and level 3 hypertension…. I just didn’t want anyone who’s suffering thinking that I was perfectly okay with him sending this- especially so soon after being discarded. It was almost unlivable. And it takes years and years and years to be okay.

   Me…
We’ve got 9 mandatory grades, after which you branch into higher ed or go vocational. It isn’t as strict as it used to be when I was branching out to my vocational detour, but anyhow.
After about 2nd grade through the end of the 9th I was cursed (and blessed) to be good enough.
I was good enough that I could skate through without doing my homework and without paying much attention. This was the good part. It was easy. Too easy.
Because it was easy, I didn’t pay attention. English and IT were the worst, because I was good at them; I’d get the 9 out of 10 without trying much, math &amp; physics not far behind as with them I’d also get 8 without trying much, 7 without trying at all.
We had pretty good teachers, but out of the dozen or so, only two, Finnish and history teachers who managed to really push and challenge me enough for me to pay attention and apply myself, for which I am ever grateful for them.
Then there was the biology / geography teacher who tried to push me, but didn’t know how, and we both failed each other… this sometimes bothers me still.
Then I had my detour with vocational school, which I sailed through easily… but finished to the deepest recession with zero jobs.
Eventually I somehow got myself into polytech… and boy was I in trouble there, because I hadn’t paid attention. It was hard trying to keep up with math, physics and nice subjects like signal processing, digital electronics, analog electronics &amp; the like.
I did okay; worked a few years and talked a boss paying me an MBA.
When I got in, I busted my ass from the day -1, and it did pay off.

   I don't know if proud is the right word since it was random luck that first introduced us, but I am thankful. We met in high school. I was a transfer student and one of my courses from my previous school was full so I got shoved into a study hall to wait until the semester ended. Study hall at that school was normally for students having actual grade issues. I didn't fall into that category so I really didn't belong there either.
A couple weeks after I transferred my algebra teacher visited the study hall. She needed a teacher's assistant to grade papers for a basic math class. She was surprised to see one of her better students sitting there and immediately asked me to take the position. So the next day I started working in her class and that's when I met the most beautiful red haired girl I've ever seen. I flirted with her at every opportunity, but she got the impression I was like that with every girl and immediately shut me down.
A year later she found out I wasn't like that at all from some common friends and she had one of those friends let me know she was interested. It turned out she did like me the first time she saw me, but was very concerned that I was the type to immediately hit on a girl I'd just met. We dated for three years before marrying and recently celebrated 30 years of marriage.
I would still encourage people to take risks when they meet somebody they like. My aggression may have turned her off at first, but she wouldn't have known about my feelings for her if I didn't share them with her.

   My family once went to some sort of festival and we won a fish from one of those arcade games. My younger brother who won the fish was very excited as the dude was handing him the fish in a bag. My dad then asks, “the fish doesn't come in a tank?” You see, around the game tent there were mini fish tanks lined up, so I guess my dad thought that the tank was included. So when the guy said that the tank wasn't included, and cost $10, my dad started arguing with him and said that he should get the tank for free cause there aren't any signs that show that the tank isn't included. At this point everyone in my family wandered off cause we were embarrassed of him (obviously). After arguing for about 5 minutes, he proceeds to try and steal the fucking thing and is now arguing with the dude and a security guard too. I think he eventually got the tank for free. The annoying part is that we already had a spare one so we didn't need that tank. In the end, all the fish we got that day died anyways :/ we have one from the year before that's still alive and pretty big, though now we have 3 tanks that we don't use.
My dad seems to perform stunts like this often and it really grinds our whole familys gears. He says we won't get anywhere in life if we don't stand up for ourselves, but we do, but we're also reasonable and don't make others miserable when doing so.
So that's probably the craziest thing I've seen my dad do

   Hello
I have a few, but they won’t seem so heroic to others. However, I was greatly impressed.
One was with our Scotch Collie, Nellie, who lived to be 19 years old. She was the sweetest dog I’ve ever known. But, she was deathly afraid of thunder and of riding in a vehicle. She would become so afraid that she would shake all over and her teeth would chatter.
However, she dearly loved us, and trusted us. More times than I can count, she would get into the car when we told her she had to go with us. I have always thought that is one of the bravest acts I’ve ever seen — to be that terrified, yet to do it anyway.
Another involves a little Scottish Terrier, McDuffie (age 3.) When McDuffie was a wee pup, I was having an exciting conversation with my lovely wife. I tend to talk with my hands and arms waving around a good bit. Well, McDuffie saw this, and was concerned for my wife (McDuffie is her soul-dog.) He wasted no time running over, sitting in front of her, glaring at me and barking at me! I thought that incredible brave for the little guy.
On another occasions, McDuffie and another Scottie, Sherlock (age 2) were in their kennel one night in our bedroom. I was standing in front of the television — a 65 inch flat screen. I was trying to swat a fly, and had my arm lifted back. About that time, a man came on the television screen, waving his arms. My little Scotties, trapped in their kennel, started growling and barking excessively at the man on screen.
I thought that incredibly cute, but also very brave.
These examples are not the pulling someone from a raging river, or stopping a bullet kind of bravery, but I think they are examples of bravery nonetheless.
Peace

   I was lucky. The deer…not so much.
Fortunately, in my 28 year career, I've only ever hit one, which was more than enough.
It was just before dawn as I was leaving the Proctor and Gamble plant in Neely's Landing, Missouri. There's only one way in and out of the plant and that's Rt177, a narrow two lane road with a culvert on each side.
I was running through the gears bringing it up to speed when out of nowhere… BAM!!! I never saw it coming. As part of our training, in a situation like that, we're supposed to take the hit. The logic being, any damage the deer might cause would be less than rolling the truck over.
I'm glad I didn't see it until I hit it, because I'm convinced my natural reaction would've been to swerve and, with nowhere to go but into the culvert, the end result would been disastrous.
I pulled over as soon as I could to inspect the damage. It's amazing what a hundred pound deer can do to a 20,000 pound tractor.
I caught the deer with the left front corner. The first thing I noticed as I exited the truck was the smell. There was guts, blood, and shit down the length of the truck. The plastic bumper was turned inside out and was rubbing against the tire. The headlight and fender mirror, aye, fuget about it…gone. The hood which is one piece molded fiberglass was cracked almost the length of the fender. To add insult to injury, the truck was only six months old.
Fortunately, the radiator and air conditioning condenser remained intact so once I removed the damaged section of bumper, I was able to drive it.
When I got it to the shop for a damage evaluation, they refused to let it in because of the smell.

   I’m going to be a drama queen here, and tell you of an incident that occured at the start of the year. As most students are from school, I was stressed, both from school and my life at home. I went to an elementary school called, Rödsleskolan. My class and I had planned an outing at an amusement park in Gothenburg (göteborg) which was fun to think about buy oh my god the stress. We had to sell meat and chocolate pralines to get up to our quota because each person payed for themselves, from what they had sold ofc. So I wasn’t that good at selling stuff, nor would I ever think to be in the future. But it was so ridiculous, I couldn’t sell literally anything. Most people had already bought food from other classes that planned the same thing. So the deadline was nearing it’s end and I find myself stressing out because I have people asking about the money, so I decide that I should take a walk to clear the air and my heavy thoughts.
I walk near a gymnasium and a person walks past me in the dark night, me with my headphones on, blasting music in my ears. I get a bad feeling from the person and I turn around. Suddenly hands sneak around both my waist and mouth. I was pushed to the ground and the guy kisses me and takes my headphones.
I don’t want to write much more down but that was the worst night in my entire life and I am still haunted by it. By my mom talking about that night sometimes to the paranoia that although had lessened since then, but still there when I take my walks at night with my dogs.
Thank you for reading.

   I am an introvert who absolutely loves the nature and animals. As I can easily be for days or weeks without seeing a human being, I struggle to be for a few days without having a contact with the nature. It’s the nature that brings me joy and happiness, that inspires me, motivates me and gives me strength.
I am also an analyst, so my job is mainly in the cities. Nonetheless, I usually choose contracts (I am self-employed) that allow me, at least partially, work from home.
Despite the fact that all the logic would say that I should be living in the city, I just can’t do it… I need my solitude and the support of the nature, therefore I chose to live on a rural property. There are 3 houses in my neighborhood, the closest is about 500m away from my home. The nearest town in 25km away, and the city I work in is 200km away. Almost every week I will get up before 3am and drive for 2,5hours to the city (I have to arrive at my motel before the peak-hour traffic starts). I will be staying for couple of nights in the motel (sometimes longer), work very long hours to get everything done I have to do in the city and then drive home again to enjoy my wonderful country life. I have been doing it for 7,5 years now. I think this shows how important for me it is to be living rural life. But why wouldn’t I chose it, if I can enjoy view like this every day:
Or having a visit from a lovely friend - I love them very much, as long as they don’t destroy my gardens! Oh well, even if they do destroy them, you simply can’t get angry with someone like that, can you?:
I think this little person also shows how relaxing the country life can be:
No, I wouldn’t give up my country, peaceful life-style for a city- or suburban rate-race.
All the best :)

   This happened in my 2nd-Grade Primary school.
We used to live in country side and will take about 45 minutes to town area.
So me and my little sister have to wake up as early as 5am because we have to arrive at school before 7am.
We usually sleep in my grandpa lorry during our journey to school.
There was this one time, i was so tired and sleepy that when i arrived school and as i sat on my chair, i slept.
Then, i heard someone is calling my name in my dream so i woke up and everybody in the class was staring at me including my teacher with her sharp eyes. I was still half-asleep. Haha
So she told me to wash my face. As i am on my way to the toilet room, i think to my self, “ Why am i in school? I thought i’m in my room and now i’m here? Something is wrong!”
After i washed my face and going back to my class, i’m still struggling to figure it out. Without any hesitation, i entered class and saw someone sit on my chair. So i came closer to the table and wish that the student would go back to his/her seat. But he/she didn’t move and kept glaring at me with confusion. I saw an empty chair nearby and sat there while everybody is looking at me. (The class was silent). Then, i slowly noticed that all the students in the class is not from my class. Finally i realize the teacher was in front glaring at me like she wanted to eat me.
Then, my mind became clear and that i entered the wrong class room!
So i quickly stand up and leave the class. I checked on the class label, it was “2BLUE”, my class is “2Red”.
So i proceeded my class and sit, with all the confusion in my head and the embarrassment i felt that time. Hahaaha

   Reviewing other awesome answers, I remembered some funny and bizarre situations working with people and helping with technology:
Diskette drive not working: I visited a friend that told me his diskette drive was not working . The cause of the problem was a bit shocking: there were two diskettes inside! Until now I can't figure out how they how could they get there.
Screen capture: A customer had a problem in their application and needed some help to fix it. So, he was asked to send some screen captures to better understand what happened. In a couple of minutes we received some digital photos, by fax, taken by the client and printed in paper before sending them. An insane amount of work!
Needed some computer parts: A good friend told me he got some computer parts, and wanted to buy the rest to get a fully working home computer. When I visited his home, I only saw a keyboard and a mouse. Pretty close, right?
Browser toolbars: In the early Internet era in the 90’s, MS Internet Explorer was the king, mainly because it comes preinstalled with every Windows machine. One of the most annoying things was the toolbars (or browser helpers) that every site asked for installation (and most people accepts). When I tried to help some friend to clean their browser, I saw a completely filled screen with toolbars, like that:
Lost tracks: A good friend told me that he saved some music from an Audio CD borrowed from a friend, but the audio was not working. When I see his computer, there was a list of small track01, track02 .cda files . Naturally, he didn’t know about CD rippers, or CD to MP3 encoders.
Virus Alert: Some people asked frequently about terrifying warnings for viruses, thousand of viruses in some cases! But generally these warnings came from some sorts of Scareware like this:
In general, these situations were more common in the early days of computers and the Internet, but always there will be people falling in some fun or bizarre situations with computers.

   My upstairs neighbor is a pleasant lady, we’ve been neighbors for 4 years now.
Her name is Karen, she's in her 60’s and pretty quiet considering she's a larger woman with some mobility issues.
She has a roommate I’ve seen twice in the last 4 years. No idea what her name is, she looks a little younger. The first time I saw was 2ish years ago, she was struggling to walk down the stairs, but said a pleasant hello neighbor!
The next time I saw her was a year ago, when a pipe burst in their AC unit, which was streaming through my ceiling. I had to knock on their front door to get the situation handled.
Karen opened the door to step out.
It was hard NOT to notice that these people were hoarders. Boxes, trash bags, clothes. Maybe you’ve seen that TLC show about it? Thats how it looked.
Oh, there was also a dog in there, a mutt about the size of a small lab. Weird. I’ve NEVER seen him out doing his business or taking a walk.
Later, after the AC leak was handled I started thinking about how strange it was.
There’s a lady living above me I never hear a peep out of, and has only been seen twice in the last four years.
There is a dog living in there. Never in the last four years have I seen a dog go in or out of the place. Where is it going to the bathroom? Has it ever been to the vet?
I have never seen a bag of trash come out of that apartment. Never. Once a week I run 1–2 bags out for the two people living in my place. Where is all their trash?
My conclusion: There are two hoarders and a dog living above me. They are so quiet I didn't realize there was more then 1 adult living there. There’s at least 4 years worth of trash above me.

   It was before few years when I was travelling from chennai to trichy. I met this person in train he must be 45 plus. He asked be about my whereabouts. I was really not ready to tell him anything about me as he was a stranger but this guy told me about his family, job, hobbies and even asked me if I want to sit in his seat (window seat). I told him about my job and bit about family. He showed his family pic, I said its ok but he was so proud about his 17 years son and wanted me to look at it. Later he asked me to show my family pic and I said I dont have that in my phone as Its a new mobile. He started asking cross questions like why dint I have that in my google drive or memory card. That pissed me off.
I just turned towards him and said Sir, I dont want to talk about my family.
He kept quiet for some times and again he started asking me about my job and team members, female colleagues, team outing. I had to answer him as I wanted to avoid talking about my family.
Finally he asked me If I like my job and I like to work more than my shift hours. I said yes. Then he gave a irritating smile and said “You are not happy with the family thats why you spend most of your time in office" and he asked “whats going on in office” and “ what are you hiding from me"….
I was holding my temper till that moment, but finally I lost it.
I gave him a very harsh look and said “Its so irritating to travel with you. Please keep quiet"
The weirdest part is he started shedding tears and said “am sorry sir" and after he did not speak to me..
This made me feel so guilty about it.
I made him cry..
But why I did??
Did I commit a sin making an elderly person cry???
I still have that guilt feeling…..

    What is the best tip you have ever left for a bartender?

   I guess this has two answers…
The best financial tip I ever left was a $20 after ordering waters all night.
Why so much for so little?
I don’t drink really except on rare occasions but I enjoy going to establishments that serve alcohol with those of my friends that do drink. Since I also have a strong need to stay hydrated well… you get the picture.
On one such evening, I could not drink enough water AND just really wasn’t having a great night. Did this bartender push me to have a “drink drink”? No. Were my soda waters poured and in my hand sometimes before I was next in line? Yes!
Was $20 US maybe a bit much? I don’t think so. In bar tending school we were taught that TIPS stands for To Insure Proper Service.
They gave me service that was above and beyond. They earned my money and were I wealthier, it would have been a lot more!
What about to the bartender that didn’t accept that I didn’t want a “drink drink” and poured whiskey into my glass all the same? The guy that didn’t accept NO for an answer when I said that I was going to have soda waters or that felt the need to comment on what a p*ssy I must be because I wasn’t ordering “like a man.”
What was my “tip” to him?
Get your resume in order.
No, I didn’t get him fired, he did that. The manager approached me in between waters after seeing what he did and hearing his comments.
You never know who you are going to serve and if they are friends with your boss or your boss’s boss. There is never a reason to be unprofessional or to act without courtesy.
Because those are what I think most people tip on, the value we assign to those concepts.

   Now, possibly more than any other time, self-proclaimed experts are in your ear telling you how bad a certain component of your diet is for your health. In fact, if you completely eliminate Component X you will avoid heart disease, cancer and in-growing toenails.
Then comes the big sell: Component X is killing you. Buy my book, come to my presentation and I will convince you of my argument. Please buy the T-shirts emblazoned with “Ban Component X” or “Fighting for a Component X-free planet” in three popular colours. We have kids’ sizes too.
If you want to be noticed in the nutrition “space” then you must tell a scary story, followed closely by the book, while engaging a rabid PR company. Right now, sugar is Component X, as it has been every decade since the 1950s. We will lose interest by the end of 2015, replacing it with another Component X, say caprylic fatty acid or amylopectin, because they are “chemicals” you haven’t heard of, therefore inherently scary (although you have been eating them since your introduction to solid food).
Don’t worry, sugar will return as Component X in October 2022. Promise.
Pop nutritionists, diet evangelists, simple solutionists just love to identify “the problem” (e.g. sugar) then preach “the solution” (ban, tax, eradicate “the problem”). It’s been that way for decades because it is an easy story to swallow, attracts the media who have no common sense filter system, befuddles politicians, and generates unease among those without an understanding of logic or biology.
If you want to become the radical nutrition preacher that attracts attention and media then stick with the single “problem” and the single “solution” so that the unthinking will become outraged and take to the streets.
The media particularly, and the populace in general, don’t have the capability to understand that the problem we really face is “crap eating” and the solution is ….. hold onto your hats, this is seriously outrageous …. “eat mainly plant foods, eat mainly least processed foods, have the occasional treat if you wish”.

    The Adjacent Possible

   So much of leadership, management, and change narrative is about “gap analysis.” The thinking goes that we achieve a desired future by describing a bold vision, defining our current location, mapping the gap between here and there, and then planning and adjusting our route at check-points along the way.
This is what grant proposals and change strategies assume and describe. This is what mission, vision, and value statements are designed to serve. But this is also orienteering, which works only when you have a working compass, an adequate map, and a reasonable expectation of persistent terrain.
But what if you and your colleagues are not independent travelers on a static landscape? What if you, the terrain, the compass, and the map all change each other in ways you can’t unbundle? And what if describing an optimal and aspirational future tells you nothing about how to take a next step, and might even blind you to other futures?
In that decision space, all you have is the current reality and the available options immediately around you. Theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman calls this space the “adjacent possible,” and considers it an essential part and partner of natural selection. Says he:
It just may be the case that biospheres on average keep expanding into the adjacent possible. By doing so they increase the diversity of what can happen next.
Evolution doesn’t have a “true north” or a long-range target. Rather, it has an array of options it explores with whatever traits or tricks it can bring to bear. Steven Johnson adapts and expands Kauffman’s idea to innovation and creativity in his book Where Good Ideas Come From, where he writes: “The history of cultural progress is, almost without exception, a story of one door leading to another door, exploring the palace one room at a time.”

    Da Vinci’s BFF, the CPA

   It’s common modern practice to consider art and commerce in opposition to each other, and artists and accountants as cartoonish polar opposites, as well. But it wasn’t always so. About 520 years ago, art and commerce, artist and accountant, lived with and learned from each other through the lives of Luca Pacioli and an up-and-comer named Leonardo da Vinci.
Da Vinci was, of course, the evolving archetype of the “universal genius,” blazing trails as an inventor, painter, sculptor, musician, anatomist, astronomer, and on and on. Pacioli was a scholar, teacher, and bestselling author in mathematics and geometry who had, among other things, clarified and codified double-entry bookkeeping.
Da Vinci had taught himself mathematics and linear perspective from Pacioli’s Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita, first printed in 1494. Two years later, da Vinci convinced his patron to invite Pacioli to Milan as part of an early “creative placemaking” initiative. While there, the two learned from and supported each other: Pacioli advised da Vinci on perspective and proportion for his large commission of the time, The Last Supper; da Vinci provided illustrations for Pacioli’s second book, the De devina proportione, an early treatise on perspective in painting. Following the French invasion of Milan in 1499, the two escaped to Mantua, where they shared a house for several years.
Da Vinci’s impact on art, science, and culture are well known. But Pacioli’s contributions were comparably transformative. He combined experience in commercial and university mathematics with scholarship in Greek and medieval Latin math as well as Hindu and Arabic innovations, such as arithmetic, algebra, and the ten digits 0 through 9. He published early advances in perspective, including the “Golden Ratio,” that da Vinci and others used to transform visual art and architecture.
But Pacioli is most famous (certainly among CPAs) for a 27-page section of his Summa, where he explained, systematized, and extended the bookkeeping practices of Venice, popularizing the double-entry accounting system that still defines modern commerce. The larger book was among the first blockbusters of the publishing world, among the first to get an author’s copyright (and an extension for the second printing), and among the first to be written in vernacular rather than Latin (Pacioli wrote: “I have written it so that it may bring advantage and pleasure to those who in literature are learned or not”).

    Sovereignty or service

  <text_body>
   We often talk about an organization having a mission, as if the organization exists as some separate entity with its own individual will. But increasingly I’m wondering if that attribution hasn’t always been upside-down. Organizations don’t have missions. Missions have organizations. And when change is necessary, it’s important to know which changes which.
Of course, organizations in the legal sense are often entities separate from their owners, managers, or staff. Long ago, civil society decided to make them separate, and give them some of the rights of individuals — to be party to a contract, to establish ownership or obligation for the entity rather than for its parts. But this was always a legal and economic fiction, not a natural fact.
Somewhere along the way, we started stretching this fiction to consider the organization as some sort of collective organism. And we started talking about the organization having a mission, constructed and confirmed over time by its constituent parts. The mission could be changed, even as the organization remained much the same. Because the organization determined its mission, not the other way around.
But underneath it all, an organization is NOT a separate, sentient entity that can choose its purpose. It is a tool, a resource, a means by which people get things done. An organization is not an organism, it is a crosscut saw, made useful by its structure and design for a particular range of outcomes. When the crosscut saw no longer fits the task, it doesn’t redefine the carpenter or the blueprint, rather the carpenter reaches for a different tool.
Perhaps it’s all semantics, but here’s the larger point: When we consider the organization as a primary, sovereign self, our work inevitably turns toward ensuring its success, survival, and sovereignty. But the organization is not sovereign, nor is it a self. It’s a hand tool in service to a larger purpose. Let’s not be so precious, or so self-important, about changing it up or switching it out.

    The shallow breathing of rational management
   </title>

  <text_body>
   So much of our training, theory, practice, and focus in cultural management has to do with outcomes and processes. When we look to improve how our organizations ‘work’, we tend to chose between ‘making better things’ (the outcomes or products), or ‘making things better’ (the processes that lead to those outcomes).
This is not a bad way to spend our time, but it’s incomplete. And it tends to leave so many arts professionals feeling short of time, short of breath, and short of energy.
In short (see what I did there?), we feel like we’re shallow-breathing, moving air at a rapid pace but not getting much oxygen.
This issue is not unique to arts organizations, but it’s particularly salient to the arts. The great waves of management theory and practice in the wider world have moved through the same attention deficits: First came product-market-output focus (in the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s), where managers differentiated functions within the company, established performance metrics (such as KPIs or Key Performance Indicators), and adjusted their work toward better outputs. Then came process-focused management theory and practice (in the 1980s and 1990s) in the form of Total Quality Management (TQM), organizational learning, workflow analysis, and other forms of midstream attention.
In systems thinking, we would call the products/outputs “stocks” — buckets of nouns that can be counted (staff levels, event nights, sales, dollars, inventory). Processes would be called “flows” — the pipeline verbs that define our activities (hiring, building, training, selling). Attending to both is essential work if you want to grow, learn, and improve over time. But only attending to those two leaves out a rather important bit of the plumbing: the source or the wellspring.
The wellspring for any enterprise is the deep, human, driving force that compels both output and process. It’s not what you do at work, or how, but rather why you’re there in the first place. This why is often deeper than rational reasoning, and beyond traditional management language.

    Auditing the obvious
   </title>

  <text_body>
   One of the oddities of moving to a new job in a new city after two decades elsewhere is that so many usually obvious things are suddenly unfamiliar.
Want to ride the public bus? Good luck figuring out what it costs, and what methods of payment are accepted (the signage is all designed for people who already know). Want to check your voicemail? Find the person with the passcode, find the manual with the access numbers, find the right extension from the six on your desk phone to make the connection. Want to print something? You’ll need to know the printer name to set it up, and then you’ll need an authorized ID card to get into the room to grab what you’ve printed. Want your ID to update and recharge? Waive it in front of the small circle on the wall in the lobby until a light turns blue. Of course.
And this is in an environment of gloriously helpful and supportive colleagues and staff. There’s no reason I should know how to do these things yet. I’m new to the system. I have to learn. And those around me have been using those systems long enough to make them obvious. After 20 years in the same place, I didn’t give a second thought to most of the infrastructure, or signage, or procedures, or barriers either.
Which brings us to the endless challenge of ‘experience audits,’ those walk-throughs we’re all supposed to do in our venues and facilities to ensure we aren’t creating barriers to full participation — accessibility, signage, front-of-house systems and services, staff guides, and all. Since quite often the people doing these audits are established staff members, they may not even SEE the things a complete stranger would see, particularly a complete stranger who had different perspectives, needs, cultural references, or experiences than them.
Not long ago, I went to a theater performance at a venue I’d never been to. And I was baffled at every turn about where to get my tickets, where to go once I had them, why people were milling around in a big clump before the show, who was staff and who was audience. And this was an otherwise wonderfully managed company with high-quality work on stage.

    More productive, less destructive

   One of my favorite moments in any planning or strategy meeting is when someone looks suddenly resolute, and says something like: “You know what the problem is? The problem is that we don’t have a system to [do or decide or develop the thing we’re talking about].”
I love this moment because, almost always, in the very next moment they describe the current system that does that thing in rather sophisticated detail.  Then everyone in the room nods and agrees that yes, that’s how it works now, and no, they don’t have a system, and yes, they need one.
There is (almost) always a system that does whatever the thing is. And everyone knows its parts and its processes. Granted, often that system sucks — it’s unproductive and sometimes destructive — but it’s there.
I remember discovering this form of public theater decades ago, at a meeting about cultural policy. Many academics, advocates, and funders were around the table, trying to improve access and impact for cultural policy research. And someone became suddenly resolute and said (something like): “You know what the problem is? The problem is that we don’t have a system to share and disseminate the most important and relevant research.” And then, in the next breath: “Right now, whenever anyone has a question about cultural policy research, they call me or a handful of other researchers, and ask for recommendations or referrals. I’m getting these calls all the time.” And the whole room nodded.
We then went on for hours discussing and designing a complex and expensive web-based database of cultural policy research, a system built from scratch to solve the “missing system” problem. And nobody used it. Instead, they kept making calls (and later emails) to a few connected people who could refer them to relevant resources.
Smart, earnest, and well-intentioned people often yearn for fresh-made systems – of information exchange, decision-making, organizational structures, reporting relationships, funding and financing, even cultural production and presentation – when they feel frustrated in their work. Or when they assume that professionals build fresh systems, and figure they should do that too.

    Sovereignty or service
   </title>

  <text_body>
   We often talk about an organization having a mission, as if the organization exists as some separate entity with its own individual will. But increasingly I’m wondering if that attribution hasn’t always been upside-down. Organizations don’t have missions. Missions have organizations. And when change is necessary, it’s important to know which changes which.
Of course, organizations in the legal sense are often entities separate from their owners, managers, or staff. Long ago, civil society decided to make them separate, and give them some of the rights of individuals — to be party to a contract, to establish ownership or obligation for the entity rather than for its parts. But this was always a legal and economic fiction, not a natural fact.
Somewhere along the way, we started stretching this fiction to consider the organization as some sort of collective organism. And we started talking about the organization having a mission, constructed and confirmed over time by its constituent parts. The mission could be changed, even as the organization remained much the same. Because the organization determined its mission, not the other way around.
But underneath it all, an organization is NOT a separate, sentient entity that can choose its purpose. It is a tool, a resource, a means by which people get things done. An organization is not an organism, it is a crosscut saw, made useful by its structure and design for a particular range of outcomes. When the crosscut saw no longer fits the task, it doesn’t redefine the carpenter or the blueprint, rather the carpenter reaches for a different tool.
Perhaps it’s all semantics, but here’s the larger point: When we consider the organization as a primary, sovereign self, our work inevitably turns toward ensuring its success, survival, and sovereignty. But the organization is not sovereign, nor is it a self. It’s a hand tool in service to a larger purpose. Let’s not be so precious, or so self-important, about changing it up or switching it out.

    The platform problem
   </title>
   <url>

  <text_body>
   Apple, Inc. has done a(nother) clever thing. In the midst of helping its customers succeed in individual goals through its iPhone and iOS systems, the company has also built resources to help groups and individuals succeed in working with each other. The App Store and iTunes are the most obvious examples. But the company has doubled down on the approach more recently. Apple isn’t just a product or software company, it’s a platform company, which is worth the attention of arts and culture managers.
A ‘platform organization’ (also called an ‘open business’ or a ‘networked enterprise’) “uses its resources to bring people together to achieve a shared purpose” (according to David Cushman in The 10 Principles of Open Business). Such organizations may well make goods or provide services, but they also direct their attention and spend their money helping other people succeed — other businesses, other social organizations, other collectives, other individuals.
Case in point is Apple’s HealthKit bundle of services and software to help app developers connect their products to the iPhone’s internal sensors and systems. The resources enable developers and their potential customers to work more seamlessly and collectively — Apple isn’t the mediator, but the host and concierge (and maybe even the plumber).
Apple’s latest cases in point are ResearchKit and CareKit (promo video below), which help medical researchers and doctors connect to potential research participants and patients in powerful, collective ways. Millions of people now carry complex, connected, personal information devices with motion sensors and global positioning. Apple is helping groups and individuals use that platform to work with each other. Now, instead of a thousand participants in a research study, there can be millions. Instead of geographically constrained data gathering, it can be global. And instead of being recipients of care, patients can be partners in their care.
What could this mean for the arts and for arts organizations? Sarah Lutman wrote a great reflection on that question back in 2013. And there are certainly many examples of arts organizations spending time and energy facilitating community success. But I’ve been increasingly curious about why it’s not happening more (in ways I can see, at least).

   Here’s an obvious premise: As we grow from children to adults, we gain proficiency in engaging the world around us. We learn its conventions, assumptions, and physical laws, and we learn to occupy, navigate, and even manipulate those things to our benefit. We learn to dress and feed ourselves, as an example. We operate increasingly complex machinery…beginning with clumsy plastic toys, moving to door handles, then to small-motor marvels like combination locks, and even cognitive/physical juggernauts like smart phones (although many infants can now use smart phones before doorknobs).
Even more than gaining proficiency in the world, however, consider that as we grow, we also perceive a greater number and wider range of “worlds” in which we CAN be proficient. When you’re a toddler, for example, you are subject to your hunger. Hunger controls you. And you can’t begin to imagine that you might have some agency in the interchange. Even after you learn to name it, it still owns you and defines who you are. If you can’t recall that feeling, go explain to a hungry toddler that they have agency over their hunger. Go ahead. I’ll wait…
As you grow, however, you begin to understand that feelings of hunger are available for your attention and intention. You can manage the physical/psychological jiu-jitsu of planning for when you will be hungry. You can feel hungry but decide to keep working for a while longer. You are no longer a subject to your hunger. Hunger is an element of your life that you can observe, explore, negotiate, and even manipulate. It may be relentless and persistent at times, but hunger has become an object available for your attention.
Why the tutorial in Constructive-Developmental Theory (which I’ve discussed before)? Well, imagine that this kind of development doesn’t stop when you become an official adult. Imagine that you are ALWAYS inhabiting some worlds in which you recognize some control, and some worlds you can’t even perceive as available to your focused attention. Imagine these worlds include complex social-cultural constructions like workplaces, organizations, schools, communities, or social strata.

    The chance and cost of being wrong
   </title>
   <url>
    https://www.artsjournal.com/artfulmanager/main/chance-cost.php
   </url>
  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   I’ve been reading a lot lately about data-informed decision making…more than is likely healthy for me. And so much of what I read begins and ends with the assumption that more data is always better. The texts jump right in to how you collect, analyze, interpret, and report data, as if it’s always a net benefit to do so. Few actually pause to explore when and why you should measure at all.
Which is why I admire and appreciate Douglas W. Hubbard’s book, How to Measure Anything. Hubbard certainly explains the how of many approaches to data gathering and analysis (in rather relentless detail). But he also spends a good portion of the book exploring the when and why. From his perspective, more information can certainly have value to a decision, but it also has a cost. And unless that value exceeds that cost, you should be spending your time, money, and attention somewhere else.
The two factors that determine the value of additional information, according to Hubbard, are:
the CHANCE of being wrong, and
the COST of being wrong.
The chance of being wrong relates to your level of uncertainty…how likely it is that you can’t frame a productive answer already. The cost of being wrong relates to consequence…how badly it will hurt if you make a poor choice, or forgo an alternate choice that would have been much better.
For many decisions we make every day, the chance of being wrong is low, because the decision is frequent and consistent and we have a good understanding of possible outcomes – your usual order at your usual coffee shop, for example.
Also for many decisions, the cost of being wrong is low. You might experience temporary disappointment, or lose a few dollars or minutes. Not pleasant, but not catastrophic either.
For these decisions, the value of more information isn’t worth the cost. Just choose, move on, and note the outcome so you make a better choice next time.

   If you have a chance to visit Bayeux, you should definitely go to the Tapestry Museum in town. The tapestry is really more of a work of embroidery and it tells the full story of William the Conqueror so that the masses who could not read would be able to understand and learn the story.
The 1,000 year old tapestry is 230 feet (70 meters) long and almost 2 feet (50 centimeters) tall and is displayed behind a glass case in a controlled environment to preserve it.
When you enter, you will get an audio guide (available in multiple languages) that describes each scene in the tapestry, which depicts the series of events between 1064–1066. There’s even a panel that features a visit to Mont St. Michel.
As you may (or may not) recall from your history class in school, 1066 marked the Battle of Hastings. William was victorious (thus the “conqueror”) and was then crowned King of England.
Not too shabby for William who went from being William the Bastard to William the Conqueror, King of England. That’s what I call upward mobility. 🙂
Historians believe that the tapestry was made in England (not France) somewhere around 1070. It was stored at times in a trunk and displayed in the cathedral at certain times of the year to commemorate William’s victory. Given its age and rough treatment, it’s amazing that it still survives, although the end of the tapestry is missing and presumed forever lost. That would perhaps make a good plot line for the next Indiana Jones movie (Indiana Jones and the Search for the Lost Tapestry) or heaven forbid, another DaVinci Code thriller.
There is no photography of the tapestry allowed but you can see pictures and learn more about the various scenes in the tapestry and its history here. Or you can take a look at the picture of the postcards I picked up in the gift shop, although they really don’t do it justice.

    Mont St. Michel in Normandy, France

   The day after our D-Day tour in Normandy, we took a guided tour of Mont St. Michel. If you have a chance to visit Normandy, I would put this as a must-see on your travel itinerary.
A Visit from St. Michel: If you build it, they will come
Mont St. Michel is about a 1.5 hour drive from our base in Bayeux through the Norman countryside. Along the way, you can see some of Le Bocage, an area of Normandy known for large hedgerows (some taller than a bus and virtually impenetrable). You’ll hear a lot about these if you study the WWII battles in Normandy. As a side note, our guide told us that the French government is now taxing the hedgerows if they are taller than a person so many farmers are cutting them down, reducing their intended purpose of shielding fields from harsh winds and erosion. But that’s another topic entirely… 🙂
Once we got close, around the city of Avranches, we could see St. Michel off in the distance, which looks like a castle rising from the sea.
As legend has it, the bishop of Avranches was visited in a dream by St. Michel who told him to build a monastery on the rock.
When he woke up, he dismissed it as a figment of his imagination and as an impossible task. Not to be deterred, St. Michel visited him again and this time, he touched the Bishop and left a mark (more of a hole) on his forehead so that he would know it wasn’t just a dream when he woke. With such evidence at hand, the bishop had no choice but to do as St. Michel said and so he did.
It was a perfect place for a monastery, isolated from the rest of the world and unreachable other than by boat or by walking the considerable distance from the mainland at low tide.

    European vacation: 4 countries in 2.5 weeks

   I’ve been very fortunate to have the opportunity to travel as part of my job. While it’s not always glamorous or easy to be away from home and family, traveling abroad has been a very enriching experience for me and it’s something that I wanted to share with my family. Our oldest graduated from high school this year so it seemed like a good excuse to plan a trip to Europe.
We asked the kids where they most wanted to go and the list included London, Paris, and Rome. We couldn’t choose between those, so under the “when are we going to get a chance to visit Europe again?”, we decided to include them all.
I had a trip to Vienna, Austria already set for June for a conference so we worked backwards from there to plan visits to the other cities. Our itinerary was perhaps a little too ambitious, or at least it felt that way at times while we were planning things, but we jumped in and it all worked out. While I won’t say that traveling from London to Paris to Rome to Vienna and back home in about 2 and a half weeks was relaxing, it was a great trip.
Over the last few years as I have become a frequent traveler, I’ve made huge progress in packing light. I’m not the lightest packer in the world, but I have drastically reduced how much stuff I bring with me. There’s a sweet spot in limiting how much stuff you bring and feeling comfortable while you’re traveling – bring too little and you maybe you feel you are missing things you need or would like to have, bring too much and you’re stuck lugging it around and keeping track of all of your stuff. This year, I’m on a quest to pack all carry-on for every trip. I’m traveling roughly one week out of every month (not including this vacation trip) and so far, so good. But that’s a post for another time. 🙂

   Not only that but it has been extremely dry, breaking and just all around  a sad hot mess 🙁
I’ve been doing an experiment for the last 6 months where I use products available to me locally, once the hair care products I  brought from the states, ran out. This is in preparation for my Peace Corps Journey.
My hair is falling out…
On top of that my scalp looks like the sahara desert and I thought I had lice.  I haven’t experienced dry itchy scalp since my decision to go natural almost 8 years ago.
After 6 months (actually 3 months)  without the majority of the products from my traveling hair regimen I experienced a hair emergency! Last saturday I set out to Cordoba to enjoy a day out in the sun (it was 72 degrees there!) and to get some aloe vera juice. And maybe some coconut oil IF if could find it. It’s quite hard to find these items in my tiny pueblo. And refraining from ordering online is apart of my experiment 🙂
In the El Cortes Ingles, which is like the spanish version of Macy’s, I found a small bottle of aloe vera juice but no coconut oil.  These two products I’ve learned are holy grail ingredients for my my tresses!
The water in my town is pretty toxic (it smells like chorine out the tap) so I’ve used strictly boiled water in my spray bottle. BUT yes, I still wash my hair in it 🙁
Aloe vera juice will help me to regain ph balance and much needed moisture to my hair.
Since I haven’t done a henna treatment in over 6 months I figured the next best treatment would be a bentonite clay mask.
Next I’ll show you a step by step of my mixture. Keep in mind that you should mix the clay with a wooden or plastic spoon. Just try to avoid using any metal bowls and silverware with this clay mixture.
Pay close attention…I will mention what I purchased while in Spain and what I have remaining from the US.

   A few months ago while still living in Botswana as a Peace Corps volunteer, I found myself mindlessly thumbing through instagram feeds of deliciously plated vegan food. At the time my body was starving on a cellular level and craved a rainbow assortment of fruit and veggies which were severely lacking in my diet. A diet of which was so poor that it caused so many disruptions to my life, general well being and ultimately led to an early departure from Botswana (I’ll write a separate post about this).
I stumbled upon an account called @brownkids managed by the beautiful couple Roe and Erin. It intrigued me that Roe, a non-vegan was the primary chef of the household and her boyfriend Erin, was a vegan. Also I was fascinated by the method they found to store their fruits and vegetables. It’s almost as if they figured out how to create a mini greenhouse…in the fridge.
I hit follow because I appreciated the philosophy of an “unapologetic living” and minimalistic life style. It’s always great when you find people on social media that you can learn from because their values are so pure. Recently I reached out to Roe when she posted about becoming debt-free.
I thought to myself this woman has so many gems up her sleeve I need to have her share her story on the site!
Now this is the first time I’ve used both audio and a written interview. But I had some complications with the full video. I lost the first 15minutes because there was no sound. So this is why it’s broken down into segments.
Note to self: find a better solution for video podcasts 🙁
In any event, I hope you like this interview and that their unapologetic living inspires you to travel far, nourish smart, and become debt-free.

    Fonty Cafe Madrid

   I am a self confessed foodie!
I will travel for miles on foot to find a restaurant I’ve read about online.
The last few weeks I spent in Spain were filled with food adventures in Madrid!
Back in May  I had one last medical check-up in Madrid (for Peace Corps) so I planned to fill my freetime with food explorations and finding free events.
Fonty Cafe had so many reviews online I had to try it.
Using Google maps I plotted out my walking route to find Fonty Cafe in Madrid, since it was relatively close to my doctors office. Major plus+
Another plus was the fact that it was in Barrio Salamanca. I loved walking around this barrio and peaking into all the little boutiques.
Now I’m really good with maps and finding my way around in foreign countries, but for some odd reason I kept getting lost.
After about 40 minutes and 1 million “Perdon, donde seta Calle de Castelló?” ,
I FINALLY FOUND THE CAFE!
It was such a relief to see the welcoming blue sign on the door!
I couldn’t contain my excitement and seriously had to calm myself down before entering. The smell of decadent pastries drifted through the folds of the door and I couldn’t wait to try EVERYTHING!
OK…maybe not everything ha ha. But it was breakfast time and I was starving since I couldn’t eat before my appointment.
Upon entering I was instantly calmed by the blues and grays of the decor. Even the floors were tiled with blue hexagon shapes to match the very inviting coziness of the place. I took mental notes of what I liked to implement in my future condo 🙂
I picked a seat next to the window and peered over the menu.
It was the typical Spanish affair of coffee with milk, tea or juice. There was also toast with tomato and ham, jam &amp; butter or an artisan pastry.
It was fairly inexpensive too and comparable to the cheap cafe around town frequented by locals.
I love “Nepolitanas con chocolat” (pastry crust filled with milk chocolate) and opted for that with Tea and orange juice.

   I know what you are thinking! Where have you been Tamara?
Haha yes! I know I haven’t posted in quite some time but for a good reason.
I’ve been busy! So much to the point that I absolutely hate the word “BUSY” now!
I’m busy…#gross…*puke*
Well a few of my Peace Corps projects are actually growing legs. I feel like I start a new one every week!
I am working with our local Women’s Sector Committee now which is exciting. For the past 12 months I spent way too much time trying to resuscitate the group. Now finally we have a committee of women eager to plan activities geared towards educating our community on issues such as teen pregnancy, the risk of multiple concurrent partners  and healthy living, just to name a few topics.
I’ve also been working on a women economic empowerment  project/curriculum that teaches finance and business skills to women &amp; girls interested in becoming entrepreneurs.
This one is slowly coming together.
I’m also trying to start a mapping/GIS project with our town planner to help map this little township. Oh and let’s not forget the theater group I started with an HIV+ activist!
Yes it sounds like a ton but some days I feel as though I could be doing more! We have our mid-service training coming up the week of November 16th as well. I can’t believe I am at the half way point already.
Yay me for making it this far!
Another project that I am working on which is not P.C. related is a new ebook! I started this one in June and am still working on it. Actually in August and September I was a bit lazy and didn’t take much action on it. But I snapped out of it thanks to Regina Anaejionu! I follow her work and advice religiously and recently purchased her 3 Day Create book. It has helped me to get it together! And most importantly get it done!

   I’ve been all talk and no solid actions for awhile when I think about the transitions that I want to make with this blog.
What started out as a platform to share my travel journey, travel advice and natural hair has grown into so much more. My interests have changed as much as my jobs in the past four years of blogging and it is time this site truly reflects my reconfigured passions and ideals.
Travel is always going to be apart of my blogging voice but there are aspects of this topic that no other blogger seems to talk about. Or we are afraid to shed light on. One aspect I’ve eluded to in the past is the ugly side of travel. The side where discussions on mental health, losing yourself in the journey, confusion of living in a new culture and fear of traveling solo as a female are hidden in the pages of google searches. Stifled by more trending topics like “Sexy beach getaways for Spring break!”.
But I’m going to start addressing these issues and pushing them to the forefront. Because we need more thought provoking discussions on positive lifestyles, mental health &amp; wellness, being your authentic self as an expat or even just preparing your family for life abroad(or you leaving them to go abroad).
I want to provide my life experiences as a examples and help those that need more resources when it comes to expat life and what they may experience from the ugly side of travel. For weeks now, I’ve been formulating in my head and blog journal how the transition will take place over the next few months. So you will notice changes on this space. As this site transitions from a mere personal travel blog to a resource site for expats, esl teachers and service workers, I definitely don’t want to lose anyone in the shuffle.
It’s hard though gaining focus on entrepreneurial efforts when you are constantly moving every one to two years. Your extended group of friends changes with your environment and even connecting with folks back home can be tricky.

  <text_body>
   I woke up at 6 today and got out the bed at 6:20 a.m. Actually I woke up at 3:37 a.m. and don’t really know when I fell asleep again. Must have been nerves. Thinking about all the elements coming together for my first ever 3-day workshop. I’ve been planning it for the past four weeks and yes I’ll admit I am an over planner. Dotting my “i’s” and crossing my “t’s” excite me. The workshop is a “training of facilitators” for the Social Transformation and Empowerment Project  better known in the Peace Corps world as STEPS (or STEPS for the future). Volunteers were trained on the program during In-Service training back in January. It’s a great program and if you have it in your country of service you should do the training. My goal at site was to train as many people in my community as possible. 14 people registered and two other volunteers from different villages are helping with the training.
Fed and dressed we left my house at 7am. The walk to my office is about 15 minutes. I was worried because I’ve never been in the office that early before and wondered if the door would be open. It was! I introduced  my volunteer friends to my coworkers then we packed up and headed down to the conference venue. As we were walking down the street my counterpart picked us up in his car.
There were already two participants waiting at the gate when we arrived. We set up all of our materials and  waited to start the training. Everyone else was late haha. They came around 8:00 a.m.-8:15 a.m. But I’ve learned to adjust to the fact the clocks are just for decoration here. Time isn’t of the essence! Either way I tried my best to stay on task with the schedule of activities for the day.
The training went well. Of the 14 people that registered only 10 showed up. However it was still a good day and the participants that came actively contributed to the discussions and were really enthusiastic about the new information we were giving them.

   A Day in the Life…
Sweat dripped down my back as I clutched my minute book and walked across the street to the government clinic. It was only 8am but the glorious morning sun was beaming and in full effect. The walk from Moloadi’s office to the clinic always takes about 5 minutes. Unless someone stops me on the way to chat adding more time to the journey.
Today I was lucky haha 🙂
In June our District AIDS Coordinating office was scheduled to partake in the Evidence Based Planning  (EBP) Retreat. This retreat brings together all the members of the District Multi-Sector AIDS Committee (DMSAC) to plan the towns HIV/AIDS activities for the next fiscal year. Each town/district sets their own goals and are also expected to work towards achieving Botswana’s national goals/framework  which calls for “zero new infections by 2016”.
You may be wondering how exactly does the town know what activities to pursue?
Well that is based off statistics.
Every quarter the DMSAC meets together to discuss the happenings from their business sector. The team is comprised of one person from all the major businesses, NGOS, CBOS, and FBOS in the community. In my town of 3500+ there are no NGOS,CBOS, or FBOS. So only the government workers, health representative from the salt &amp; soda ash mine, teachers and water company employees are represented. The majority of the data used during the EBP came from the government clinic.
So on this very day I set out to document the rest of the missing data we needed for our spreadsheets. Phoning ahead and speaking with the nurse in charge would assure that the materials were ready and waiting for me upon arrival. And they were!
Walking into the clinic always reminds me of the first season of the Walking Dead when Rick wakes up in the hospital. It’s just so dark and gloomy. As I walked down the long hallway I made sure to say “dumela” to the patients I passed. The nurse and I bumped into each other and she directed me to the room where the files were waiting.

   Back in January my older sister came to visit me in Botswana. We had the chance to tour around the northern region of the country and then headed over to Livingstone Zambia to see Victoria Falls.
Here are a few highlights and pictures from the trip!
Victoria Falls, Zambia
My favorite photos of the trip were from Victoria Falls and Jungle Junction.
The waterfall was experiencing low levels but it was still magnificent to see. There is something very tranquil and serene about watching water gush over the slippery slopes of the rocks. From this angle there was also a nice sprinkling of water which was welcomed as the day was hot.
In Livingstone, Zambia, we stayed at Livingstone Backpackers. They have a daily “shuttle” that will bring you to the entrance of the park. Outside the entrance there are a number of shared and privates taxis for the ride back. The taxi was 6 kwacha ($6) and the ride is about 15 minutes. So don’t waste money on hiring a tour guide to drive you to the falls. This one guide was charging us 100 kwacha to go to the falls (from the hostel). And he can’t actually bring us inside for a “guided tour”. The entrance fee was $20 (USD/200 kwacha). You can also check the Zambia Tourism website for fee updates.
The Zambia side of the falls has many hiking trails to explore if you are interested in seeing more than just the waterfalls. The only thing to be mindful of are the packs of baboons that lurk throughout the “forest”. I dislike baboons because they try to steal your belongings in search of food and they are dangerous. My sister and I were going down to the “boiling point” trail, which would have taken about a 25 minute  walk from the entrance, but I saw baboons and turned back. She wanted to keep going…but noooope not I…you can go alone haha. Peace!

   My experience as an international Volunteer for the past 19 months has been interesting to say the least. As you know this isn’t my first time volunteering abroad nor is it my first time living and working abroad. In light of this I chose to come into this new environment with no expectations. Actually my only missions were to be of service to others and continue to live in my light and purpose (more like continue to figure it out!).
Where you’re meant to be is, where you’re meant to be right??
This journey has given me a great deal of lessons on how your relationships with people will greatly impact your perspective on the work your meant to do. OK, I already know what you are thinking: “That sounds very vague Tamara, please explain!”
I’ll share two lessons that have continued to appear the last several months.  That may help to explain my point.
Always vet people out before agreeing to work with them!
Yes. This lesson appeared first in 2014 and I understood it’s implications almost immediately. But now nearly two years later and back in the same situation, I had to reanalyze whether or not I fully grasped the original lesson. I think my frame of mind was just laser focused on two specific situations that occurred when in actuality there were several instances. I’m a creative being at heart and love to collaborate with other creatives and likeminded people. You never really know someones work ethic or motives until something goes wrong. Even if you talk about your work plan in the beginning and carefully hash out responsibilities, problems will arise.
The way these problems are resolved will dictate exactly the kind of person or work partner you are dealing with. Now looking back I’ve been in this situation several times (this past 19 months) with male and females and have come to the conclusion that vetting people out in the beginning is important, but also to be mindful of the little idiosyncrasies of selfishness and greed that may present themselves.

    Reflecting in Vietnam
   </title>

  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   I talk a lot about traveling on this blog. A LOT! I mean after all this is a website devoted to the art of travel. The fabulous places to visit, sights to see, and incredible people you will meet. However I’ve only briefly touched on what I like to coin as the Ugly Side of Travel. Today’s expat interviewee shares a candid reflection on life in Vietnam.
You won’t read many travel sites that actually give you the real deal about life in a foreign country as an expat or tourist. You hardly see writers depicting honest accounts of the racism you may experience abroad as a black solo female traveler. Or the panic &amp; anxiety of having to carefully maneuver around groups of hungry seedy eyed men in a restless mining. Or realizing that those stories that you read on blogs or in travel magazines that romanticize the journey are just that…stories!
Ok let me be clear…YES…the journey is different for everyone. But it’s time we start to really share the truth about the obstacles that we (travelers) endure when we put ourselves out there in discovery of a new place. Travel moves you, breaks you at the core, and shakes up your spirit to new beliefs about your identity and personal life philosophies you never knew existed within you.
I spent the past nine months cultivating a book that explores how to deal with the effects of the Ugly Side of Travel. And what to do when the experience leaves you jaded.
It’s real!
About 2 years ago now I connected with a young woman via Instagram that stepped outside life in NYC to go travel and teach in South Korea! Little did I know then, how much we would have in common with regards to our journey around South Korea and Vietnam. Of course I couldn’t let the opportunity go by to feature her expat interview on this site:)

    THE ANTI-AGING KALE PESTO PASTA SALAD
   </title>
   <url>

  <text_body>
   Can pasta salad help you live longer? That might be a stretch, but lately I have been fascinated with longevity research and I recently stumbled across this interview with USC’s Valter Longo (the godfather of longevity research) on the impact of diet on aging and longevity (hint: he recommends a mostly plant-based diet). In that interview he said, “Other than genes, it is hard to think of something that can be more powerful than food in determining whether someone is going to make it to 100 or die before 50 years old.”
He went on to talk about an “ideal” meal with a little pasta, a bunch of garbanzo beans, and a whole bunch of greens/veggies (he’s Italian, naturally). But classic Italian/Mediterranean diet isn’t about mountains of pasta – just *a little* pasta with a ton of other nutrient-dense food. As he puts it:
“the Italians who lived so long never ate the large bowls of ‘only pasta’ that people associate as being authentic Italian food. They were the old Italians for whom even pasta was expensive. So they ate what they could grab from their backyards, which was mostly legumes and vegetables, with some pasta. People are accustomed to eating a bowl of pasta or rice with a little bit of whatever on top; it should be the other way around.”
I found that idea so inspiring… a bowl with a little pasta and whatever you can find in your garden – a bunch of beans/peas, tomatoes, leafy greens, and more. It’s classic One Ingredient food. So I have been experimenting and evolving that idea for a while and I’ve ended up at the recipe below.
This is seriously the most complete meal I think I’ve ever made; plenty of whole-grain carbs, complete protein from the beans + pasta, about 9 cups of leafy greens, veggies, mushrooms, and more. It tastes SO good and satisfying, and I always feel healthy and energized after eating it (unlike with a pure bowl of pasta). I’ve made a big batch multiple times over this last month and eaten it twice a day on some days. It’s perfect.

    HOMEMADE GOLDEN CHAI TEA LATTE CONCENTRATE
   </title>
   <url>

  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   Someone emailed me the other day asking for recipes or ideas on how to get more turmeric in their diet. That might sound like a strange request if you aren’t hip to all the health nerd news, but I immediately knew what he was talking about.
You see, consuming 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of turmeric every day is one of the very best things you could do to improve your health. Turmeric is perhaps the most anti-inflammatory food on the planet (and inflammation seems to be the primary cause of pretty much every disease). The scientific research is littered with its powers. Here’s just a handful of videos from NutritionFacts.org about the myriad benefits of this spice (you should really set aside a few minutes to watch these). Turmeric seems to…
Boost endothelial/arterial function as much as exercise
Show promise against pancreatic cancer
Fight colon cancer
Prevent Alzheimer’s disease
Help prevent diabetes
The thing is, how do you actually take the stuff?! There are pills you can take, but it appears that the fancy “extracts” in the pills aren’t even as effective as the plain ol’ spice itself. Hence the question I got from a reader. Other than a few curry recipes that include the spice, I didn’t have a good solution for a recipe you could quickly prepare every day to get your 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric.
It has a strange flavor on its own and is way too strong to eat straight up. But I started experimenting and realized that it pairs really nicely with other spices like cinnamon and cloves (like in a curry), and I remember the whole “golden chai latte” craze which is basically chai tea spices with turmeric instead of black tea mixed with milk. But it would be a bit time-consuming to prepare a golden chai latte every day… so what I ultimately came up with is a simple golden chai “concentrate” that you can make at home in about 10 minutes and has enough servings to last you about a week.

    The Story of the Toast Art
   </title>
   <url>
    http://www.oneingredientchef.com/toast-art/
   </url>
  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   This week marks the FIFTH anniversary of One Ingredient Chef (time flies!) and I thought I would take a moment to let you know about a project that I’ve been working on behind the scenes for quite some time. It is a fine art project focused on the subject of toast. Obviously, that’s going to require a little explanation…
Success and Toast and Failure
To understand why toast became such an important subject, let’s take a trip back to 2014. It was about a year after I started this One Ingredient blog. In those early days, things were going better than I could have expected. I had hundreds of thousands of visitors, a big-shot literary agent in New York shopping a cookbook deal, investors were reaching out wanting to start a restaurant. I mean, I just started posting vegan food online and things were getting a little crazy!
All of this must have been going to my head because I decided that the first product I was going to create for One Ingredient Chef would be a set of four fine art photo prints of… toast. I had previously done a recipe with overhead shots of toast on white backgrounds and they looked super-cool. So, I spent a week recreating the perfect toast photos and having them printed as 8×8-inch photo prints, got nice frames, and prepared them for their big sale.
Hilariously, the plan was to make a limited edition of just 250 sets because, you know, I wanted them to be really exclusive.
I sent out the email blast to my few thousand subscribers offering these prints for sale and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Now, by ‘overwhelmingly positive,’ I mean people said nice things about them; I do not mean they sold well. They sold exactly zero copies. Thousands of potential customers and zero sales (they weren’t even expensive!). It was the only time in my life when I tried to sell a product and didn’t even make one sale.

    How to Get Instant Nutrition Facts for Any Recipe
   </title>
   <url>
    http://www.oneingredientchef.com/how-to-get-nutrition-facts/
   </url>
  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   Some of the most common questions I get about my recipes are in reference to the nutrition information. “How many calories does this soup have?” or, “how many grams of fat are in these cookies?”
Up until now, my answer has always been something like, “I dunno…” because this is a much more complicated question than it seems. While there are countless websites and mobile apps designed to help you find calorie information for different ingredients, that’s not too helpful for entire recipes. Finding the grams of fat in one serving of my Sesame Rice Bowl, for example, is no trivial matter… First, you’d have to look up the fat in brown rice. And then sun-dried tomatoes. And then a few slices of cucumber. Each of these ingredients would then need to be written down, divided by weird fractions for each serving, and then added together. The end result (assuming the math was correct) would still be a rough estimate and you would have to start at the beginning for calories, carbs, sodium, and more until your calculator catches fire and you throw your hands up in frustration.
Calculating nutrition facts by hand is an absolute nightmare.
Thankfully, dear readers, there’s a better way. I was excited to recently discover a free resource that allows you to create a nutrition label for any recipe you find online, and I thought it could be useful to give you a quick overview of how it works. The tool is located at VeryWell.com and it’s incredibly simple to use: to make a complete nutrition label, all you have to do is paste a list of ingredients into a text box, click a button, and it’ll churn out all the details in seconds – complete with a per-serving breakdown. Here’s a quick tutorial of how this tool can be used…
Find the recipe in question, highlight the entire ingredient list, and right-click to copy everything. For this example, we’re using my recent Sunflower Pesto Tabbouleh. You can also do this with a printed recipe, just have your ingredient list handy by your computer.

    8 Scientific Reasons Why Vegan Men Are More Manly
   </title>
   <url>
    http://www.oneingredientchef.com/vegan-men/
   </url>
  </metadata>
  <text_body>
   It’s common for men to believe that meat makes us manly. Salads and smoothies are fine for the ladies, but grilling juicy steaks is just part of being a guy… or so we’re taught.
I’d suspect that this stereotype is a huge hurdle for a lot of men who would otherwise like to explore a vegetarian diet. Even in my own life, I bought into the “meat is manly” idea just like the next guy. When I first went vegan many years ago, I felt embarrassed to order a veggie burrito at Chipotle for the first time, as if people would laugh at me or something. I realized that was insane pretty quickly, but it is nevertheless a real challenge for most men.
Even now, I am still one of the few male vegan food bloggers and a full 90% of my audience is female. Hmm…
Here’s the good news: the stereotype is complete BS. While it exists in the heads of men everywhere, the data tells a different story. A 2011 poll found that 3% of American men reported “Never eating meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs” while just 2% of women reported the same. In other words, even accounting for a margin of error, there are at least as many vegan men as women. The difference is that men are not as vocal about this dietary choice because it’s not as acceptable for us.
I think that’s nonsense. Clearly, men are a growing part of the vegan population, and it’s hardly making us less masculine. I can prove it. Here’s the science that shows how a vegan diet can actually make a man more manly:
If there is one scientific way to measure a man’s manliness, it would surely be testosterone – the hormone that literally defines masculinity. Men might assume that their testosterone levels would plummet by eating nothing but plants, but that’s just the stereotype at work again. A British Journal of Cancer study of 696 men (233 of whom were vegans) concluded this: “Vegans had 13% higher T [testosterone] concentration than meat-eaters and 8% higher than vegetarians.” Not only did vegan men have as much testosterone as meat eaters, they actually have 13% MORE of this manly hormone.

    10 Reasons to Get Your Milk From Nuts Instead of Cows

   If I could recommend just one step towards eating a healthier diet, what would it be?
Ditch dairy.
From a health perspective, I would almost rather eat meat and eggs than cow’s milk. With the sex hormones and saturated fat and pus and nearly indigestible lactose from these diseased and heartbroken cows, there’s really nothing good to say about dairy.
Here are the top 10 reasons to wean yourself off the udders and start getting your milk from soybeans and nuts and seeds instead:
1. Hormones
As with most other mammals, cows only lactate when pregnant, and are thus kept pregnant nearly constantly. This leads to incredible levels of estrogen. On top of that, they are also injected with even more hormones to produce much more milk than they ever could naturally. Where are all these hormones going? The milk, of course! And we consume that milk. Excessive intake of these hormones (particularly estrogen and insulin-like growth factor 1) are very closely tied to cancers in the parts of our body that are influenced most strongly by sex hormones (source) – breasts, ovaries, and prostates – which result in a combined 500,000 cancer diagnoses each year. It is no surprise, then, that men who consume more dairy products are 30% more likely to develop prostate cancer than those who consume little or no dairy (source).
2. Saturated Fat
Dairy products might be linked to the #2 cause of death (cancer) but what about our #1 killer, heart disease? It turns out that dairy is the single largest source of saturated fat in our diet (source). At least one third of all saturated fat consumed in America comes from cheese, butter, milk, and other dairy-based products. Given that saturated fat is a primary cause of heart disease and obesity, it doesn’t seem so smart to chug glass after glass of this “liquid meat” as Rip Esselstyn likes to call it.

    US House Has Next Try on Difficult Immigration Debate

   The collapse of the U.S. Senate effort to find a legislative fix for millions of undocumented young people has thrown into question whether the U.S. Congress will be able to act at all on the contentious issue of immigration.

The Senate voted down even the possibility of debate on four separate immigration reform proposals on Thursday, dashing hopes for reform after decades of division in Congress.

Both Republicans and Democrats said President Donald Trump's criticism of a bi-partisan deal brokered at the last minute helped sink the measure. Meanwhile, a proposal modeled after Trump's four-point immigration plan emerged as the least popular, winning the votes of 39 senators.
The failure to secure a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people eligible for DACA (Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals) followed months of negotiations between Capitol Hill and the White House.

With lawmakers out of session for the next ten days, time for securing a DACA fix is running out. Trump ended DACA benefits beginning March 5. While two courts have acted to extend the deadline, DACA beneficiaries could still be at risk of deportation unless Congress acts.
"I think it's safe to say it's been a disappointing week. I kept my commitment to set aside an entire week for a broad, productive debate over DACA," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly after votes Thursday. "But once again, when the hour came to make law, instead of just making political points, our friends across the aisle were either unable or unwilling to get something done."

McConnell's limitation on debate gives Congressional Republicans the upper-hand politically in a tough mid-term election year.

"That really advantages Republicans who either don't want to provide relief for DACA recipients or only want to do so in conjunction with other immigration policy changes that Democrats are not willing to accept," Brookings Institution fellow Molly Reynolds told VOA.

The move also benefits the White House, which said Thursday Senate Democrats failed to take immigration reform and homeland security seriously.

    Hundreds of Immigrant Youth Continue to Fight for a DACA Solution

   Undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children demonstrated in the halls of Congress Wednesday because of a Senate budget agreement that excluded them.
The Senate’s two-year budget deal kicked the immigration debate into next week, leaving the immigrants, known as Dreamers, in continued limbo.
Before their protests on Capitol Hill, hundreds of Dreamers convened at the Lutheran Church of Reformation in Northeast, Washington, where they vowed to fight on.
“We know that we can’t step back. It’s not an option for any of us,” Berenice Davila, a 19-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient from Texas, told VOA.
DACA is an Obama administration policy established in 2012 that deferred deportation actions for some undocumented people who entered the U.S. as minors. The program granted them work permits for renewable two-year periods. The Trump administration rescinded the policy in 2017, creating a March 5 deadline for protections from deportation to end.
Davila was one of the voices during the National Day of Action for a Clean Dream Act that brought together more than 10 organizations from Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.
“All we ask is a permanent solution that does not harm anyone else in our community,” Davila said.
Her family, who overstayed their visas a “few years ago,” moved from Mexico when Davila was 3 years old.
“DACA absolutely changed everything about my life,” she said. “Without [DACA], I wouldn’t be able to enroll for dual credit classes (classes that earn high school and college credits) that I was completely qualified for.”
Speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to bring immigration up for debate soon.
With lawmakers’ attention focused on high-stakes negotiations securing a two-year spending agreement, debates on the future of DACA recipients must wait until next week.
“Our upcoming debate on DACA, border security and other issues will be a process that is fair to all sides,” McConnell said.

    Budget Bickering Shuts Down Parts of US Government; Vote Set for Monday

   Blaming each other for the political deadlock, Republican and Democratic lawmakers closed the first day of a partial shutdown of the U.S. government with few signs of agreement on a spending bill tangled in a fight over immigration.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Saturday night he had scheduled a vote for 1 a.m. Monday on a new spending bill that would keep the government open until Feb. 8. The vote puts pressure on Senate Democrats to reach an agreement or risk voting down a government spending bill for the second time.
Spending authority expired at midnight Washington time Friday, triggering a halt of non-essential functions.
Lawmakers are at odds over a range of defense spending and immigration issues, including a legislative fix for nearly 800,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.
Senators resumed debate Saturday afternoon on a temporary spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8. Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, however, objects to the continuing series of temporary spending bills, saying it “simply kicks the can down the road and fails to get the job done for the American people.”​

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham Tweeted Saturday afternoon, “I know it looks like a mess — but there are many senators of good will who want to solve the problem.” Graham thanked Democratic Senators “commitment to hard work and finding solutions last night.”
Senators marked the first day of the shutdown shuttling back and forth among each others’ offices in the hopes of hammering out a deal.
The U.S. House of Representatives stayed in session Saturday, voting on a rule that would allow the body to quickly consider any newly negotiated legislation sent over from the Senate. The House was set to return to work Sunday in the event the Senate reached a compromise.
“The President will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

    House Passes Spending Measure to Avert Shutdown; Senate Debate Resumes Friday
   </title>

   U.S. senators adjourned late Thursday without voting on a bill to fund the government beyond Friday.
Senators will resume debate Friday morning on a bill passed by the House late Thursday on a vote of 230-197.
Lawmakers had two options: Agree to a one month, temporary spending measure, known on Capitol Hill as a continuing resolution (CR), or shut down the government until funding could be agreed on.

Democrats withheld support for the bill, forcing negotiations between House Speaker Paul Ryan and the conservative House Freedom Caucus to ensure the bill would pass. House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows secured commitments for future votes on military funding and an immigration bill favored by conservatives.
“They’re going to whip it and help us get to 218,” House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Raul Labrador said of leadership’s commitments to bring his immigration bill, co-sponsored with House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte, up for a vote. The bill includes a permanent legislative solution for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
In September, President Donald Trump ordered an end to the Obama administration program that shielded young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
Congressional Democrats have pushed for the short-term spending bill to include a fix for the 800,000 DACA recipients, who will lose their protection from deportation March 5, unless Congress acts.
The temporary measure faces a tough road to passage in the Senate, where Republicans’ vote margins are much narrower. If the temporary measure is approved, lawmakers will use the next month to negotiate a spending package to cover the rest of fiscal 2018, which ends Sept. 30.
“Senator (Chuck) Schumer, do not shut down the government,” Speaker Ryan said to reporters after the bill passed, referring to the Senate minority leader. “We need to make sure our men and women in uniform get the resources they need so they don’t get the rug pulled out from under them.”
Eleven House Republicans voted against the spending bill, including Florida Representatives Carlos Curbleo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who vowed to vote against any legislation that did not include action for DACA recipients.

    Iran Protests Revive Bitter US Political Divides

   President Donald Trump blamed former president Barack Obama Tuesday for "foolishly" giving Iranian leadership money as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement negotiated by his administration, tweeting a claim the funds "went into terrorism and into their pockets."
Trump's tweet recalled the bitter and ongoing political divide over the deal and the U.S. approach to the Islamic Republic, as protests in Iran reached their sixth day on Tuesday. At least 21 people are reported killed in those nationwide protests.

Trump has drawn a clear comparison to Obama's response to the June 2009 Green Revolution, when the former president told reporters "it's up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders should be."

Republican critics in Congress said Obama should have been more forceful in support of the Green Revolution, after it was triggered by a presidential election protesters said was fraudulent. Their frustration with the Obama administration's approach to Iran only deepened after the nuclear deal offered Iran relief from economic sanctions in return for concessions on the development of the country's nuclear program.
The deal is now in question after Trump refused to certify it in mid-October, saying "in the event we are not able to reach a working solution with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated."
The 60-day deadline for Congress to address Trump's refusal to re-certify the deal begins on January 11. But the appetite for scrapping the deal is thin, even among Republicans.

"As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it," House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Ed Royce said at an October House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.

Congress could pass legislation that would find a middle ground between Trump's rejection of the deal and the significant consequences of U.S. withdrawal from the agreement. The recent protests are likely to hasten that possibility.

    US House Passes Resolution 'Condemning Ethnic Cleansing of Rohingya'
   </title>

  <text_body>
   The U.S. House of Representatives condemned the "ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya" on Wednesday, passing a resolution (423-3) by a two-thirds voice vote "calling for an end to the attacks" against the Muslim minority in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
The resolution is the first step in congressional action that could eventually include a stand-alone sanctions bill aimed at putting financial pressure on the Burmese military and providing U.S. economic assistance for the resettlement of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh back to Myanmar.

“This is a moral issue and a national security issue,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, a Republican from California, said on the House floor Tuesday. “No one is secure when extremism and instability is growing in this part of the world.”
An estimated 600,000 Rohingya have been displaced in recent months, fleeing into Bangladesh and creating a humanitarian crisis.

“Hundreds have been killed,” Royce said as he described the scope of the crisis. “At least 200 villages have been burned to the ground, landmines have been placed inside Burma’s border with Bangladesh, maiming refugees who are seeking safe haven. There are reports of rapes and all types of violence committed against the Rohingya.”

The bipartisan resolution - co-sponsored by Democratic Congressman Joe Crowley of New York and Republican Representative Steve Chabot of Ohio - calls for “an end to the attacks in and an immediate restoration of humanitarian access to the state of Rakhine in Burma.”

The resolution also calls on Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto head of Myanmar's government, and the Burmese military to work together to implement humanitarian aid and reconciliation.
"The Burmese military's widespread brutality toward Rohingya civilians over the last few months and its attempts to drive them out of the country are deeply disturbing.” Chabot told VOA in a statement on the passage of the resolution. "That is why Congressman Crowley and I introduced H.Con.Res. 90, to condemn this ethnic cleansing and show the American people’s outrage at these attacks.

    Congressional Movement Grows to Save DACA by Year's End

   A group of House Republicans is preparing a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan to find a legislative fix by December for almost 800,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Their eligibility to remain in the country hangs in the balance as part of an end-of-year legislative pileup on Capitol Hill.
President Donald Trump rescinded the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program earlier this year, calling on Congress to pass legislation that would provide DACA recipients with a path to permanent status in the U.S. before the program phases out in March 2018.
The effort to gather signatures for the letter is being led by Virginia Republican Scott Taylor, according to Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, a New Mexico Democrat, who spoke with reporters in a background briefing Thursday morning. Taylor's office did not respond to a VOA request for comment.
Grisham said she did not have the text of the letter, but her sense of it was that if a legislative option was not offered, members would sign on to a discharge petition that would force a vote on a DACA bill. That petition was introduced by Republican Mike Coffman earlier this year.
Coffman told VOA he was "certainly optimistic something is going to be done before March." He said he would have to consider any letter that sought a more immediate solution.
For their part, Democrats "are still very clear as a caucus," Grisham said. "We have to do it by the end of the year."

The DACA program does not confer legal status but does give recipients temporary protection from deportation and permission to legally work. Grisham said 122 recipients "are negatively impacted every single day" because their protection expires.

Democrats have tried to tie DACA legislation to the government budget bill. Funding for the government runs out next Friday, so either the bill or a temporary extension must be passed by then to avoid a government shutdown.

    Undocumented Youths Wait on Government Funding Battle in Congress

   The future of almost 800,000 undocumented young people in the United States is hanging in the balance in an end-of-year legislative pileup on Capitol Hill that could result in the shutdown of the federal government.
The government will run out of money December 8 unless Congress approves a new budget or budget extension. While the focus this week has been largely on the Senate's approval of its tax cut bill, the budget bill could have greater short-term ramifications. The Republican-dominated Senate cannot pass it alone; Democratic votes will be needed.
But both houses of Congress will have to vote on a spending measure before it can go into effect.
And underlying all the discussions of spending priorities is finding a permanent solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave temporary protection from deportation, and permission to legally work, to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.
President Donald Trump rescinded the Obama administration measure earlier this year, calling on Congress to pass legislation that would provide DACA recipients with a path to permanent status in the U.S. before the program phases out in March 2018.

Democrats initially pushed for stand-alone legislation to address the problem, but given the country’s contentious immigration debate, they have instead tried to tie DACA legislation to the spending bill.
Some Democrats have vowed to vote against any budget bill that does not include a DACA fix, threatening a government shutdown when the funding runs out.
But House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has said the fix to the DACA program should “be considered on its own merits” and not as part of a larger spending bill.
Moves toward any bipartisan agreement stalled before a planned meeting Tuesday when Trump tweeted that he “didn’t see a deal” with Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer of New York and Nancy Pelosi of California, respectively.

    Pompeo to Meet with Top N. Korean Official in NY

   WHITE HOUSE — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet later this week with a North Korean four-star general in New York for talks related to a planned summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader, according to the White House.
Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the powerful Central Committee and North Korea's former spy chief, departed Beijing on an Air China commercial flight Tuesday for John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that Kim's visit is a "solid response to my letter, thank you!"
"Kim Yong Chol is the man who whispers in Kim Jong Un's ear. Not only does he advise him on strategy but he also conveys the leader's demands. He'll be coming to New York to negotiate on Kim Jong Un's behalf. It's another very strong sign of commitment to this summit," said Jean Lee, director of the Korea program at the Wilson Center.
Lee, former Pyongyang bureau chief for the Associated Press, tells VOA tough discussions should be expected "as the U.S. and North Korean sides try to get on the same page regarding what the two leaders will accomplish at this anticipated summit."
Trump sent a letter last week to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying their scheduled June 12 summit in Singapore would not happen, and blaming what he said was "tremendous anger and open hostility" shown in a statement from Pyongyang. But negotiations between the two countries have continued, including talks at the Korean demilitarized zone.
"If it takes place on June 12th, we'll certainly be prepared. If it, for some reason, takes place at a later date, we'll be prepared for that as well," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Tuesday afternoon on Air Force One.
A number of factors will determine when it is scheduled, Sanders added.
"Denuclearization has to be on the table on the focus of the meeting," she explained. "And the president has to feel like we're making progress on that front."

    Top N. Korean Official Heading to US for Talks on Summit

   WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump has confirmed a top North Korean official is to visit New York for talks related to a planned summit between Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
"Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York," Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter.
Hours earlier, news reports said Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of North Korea's ruling party and former military intelligence chief, was at the Beijing airport. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Kim planned to fly Wednesday to New York.
Trump sent a letter last week to Kim Jong Un saying the summit scheduled for June 12 would not happen, blaming what he said was "tremendous anger and open hostility" shown in a statement by the North Korean leader.
But negotiations between the two countries have continued, including talks Sunday at the Korean demilitarized zone.
"We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more," Trump said Tuesday.
White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin and others from the Trump administration flew Sunday to Singapore, the planned site for the summit.
"They traveled to Singapore to focus on logistics preparations," a White House official confirmed to VOA News on Monday.
Before the Trump-Kim meeting, the U.S. president also plans to hold face-to-face discussions with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
"We agreed to meet before the U.S.-North Korea summit," Abe said in Tokyo following a Monday telephone call with Trump.
Trump and Abe also "affirmed the shared imperative of achieving the complete and permanent dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missile programs," according to a White House statement.
Trump and Abe are to attend the Group of Seven economic summit June 8-9 in Canada, but may meet at the White House prior to that, according to officials in Washington and Tokyo. It is unclear when or where Trump and Abe will meet before the anticipated Singapore summit.

   WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plan to hold face-to-face discussions before a planned summit between Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
“We agreed to meet before the U.S.-North Korea summit,” Abe told reporters in Tokyo following his Monday telephone call with Trump.
In the call, Trump and Abe also “affirmed the shared imperative of achieving the complete and permanent dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missile programs,” according to a White House statement.
Both Trump and Abe are set to attend the Group of Seven economic summit June 8-9 in Canada, but the two may meet at the White House prior to that, according to officials in Washington and Tokyo.
The two leaders spoke Monday as American officials were in North Korea and Singapore to discuss arrangements for the prospective talks.
The phone conversation took place before Trump went to Arlington National Cemetery for a Memorial Day ceremony. There, the president made no reference to the situation on the Korean peninsula in his 22-minute scripted remarks.
Nearly 34,000 Americans died as a result of hostile action in the three-year war on the peninsula. Hostilities ceased in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty has ever been signed.
It is unclear when or where Trump and Abe will meet before the anticipated Singapore summit, which the U.S. president has said in recent days is likely to occur on June 12 after he declared last Thursday that the summit would not be held on that day.
Both Trump and Abe are set to attend the Group of Seven economic summit June 8-9 in Canada.
U.S. and North Korean officials met again Monday at the Korean demilitarized zone.
Sung Kim, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and former envoy to South Korea, is leading the U.S. delegation at the preparation talks.Reports say the meetings are expected to last until Tuesday.
Meanwhile, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin and others from theadministration took a flight Sunday to Singapore.
“They traveled to Singapore to focus on logistics preparations,” a White House official confirmed to VOA News on Monday.

    North Korea Willing to Talk to US 'At Any Time'

   WHITE HOUSE — North Korea said Friday that it was still willing to sit for talks with the United States “at any time, (in) any format,’’ after President Donald called off a summit with the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, a longtime nuclear negotiator and senior diplomat, said in a statement carried by state media that the North is “willing to give the U.S. time and opportunities” to reconsider talks that had been set for June 12 in Singapore.
Trump canceled his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, blaming recent threatening statements by Pyongyang to pull out of the summit over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials.
“I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and, indeed, a setback for the world,” said the president in noontime remarks in the White House Roosevelt Room before signing an unrelated bill.
The president also warned that the military forces of the United States are “more ready than we have ever been before,” along with allies South Korea and Japan, should North Korea take any “foolish or reckless acts.”
Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s recent criticisms of certain U.S. officials had been a reaction to unbridled American rhetoric, and that the current antagonism showed “the urgent necessity” for the summit.
“We have inwardly highly appreciated President Trump for having made the bold decision, which any other U.S. presidents dared not, and made efforts for such a crucial event as the summit,” Kim Kye Gwan statement said.
“We even inwardly hoped that what is called ‘Trump formula’ would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue,” he said, without elaborating.
On Thursday morning, the White House released a letter Trump wrote to Kim saying: "I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate at this time to have this long-planned meeting."

   WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Trump administration’s travel restrictions on citizens from five Muslim countries, handing President Donald Trump a victory in enforcing one of his most controversial policies.
In a 5-4 split decision, the high court justices ruled that the president has the constitutional authority under U.S. immigration laws to limit travel from foreign countries over national security concerns, as the administration has argued. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion, writing that Trump’s September 2017 executive order restricting travel is “squarely within the scope of presidential authority” under U.S. immigration laws.
The president has “undoubtedly fulfilled” the requirement under the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act that the entry of the targeted foreign travelers “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” Roberts wrote.
The chief justice also dismissed arguments of the challengers — the state of Hawaii, the Hawaii Muslim Association and three residents — that the travel restrictions violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which bars favoring one religion over another.
Unsurprisingly, the court’s four liberal justices dissented from Tuesday’s ruling.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened it to a 1944 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the U.S. government’s authority to place Japanese-Americans in military internment camps during World War II.
“History will not look kindly on the court’s misguided decision today, nor should it,” Sotomayor wrote.
Under the travel ban, issued in September after courts blocked its two earlier permutations, citizens of five Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen — as well as North Koreans and some Venezuelan officials — are barred from traveling to the United States.
Chad, another predominantly Muslim nation, was initially on the list, but was dropped in April after the U.S. government said the country had complied with its information-sharing requirements.
The decision caps nearly 17 months of intense court battles between an administration determined to fiercely defend the president’s travel orders on grounds of national security and executive authority and detractors who characterized it as an ideologically inspired “Muslim ban.”
In a statement, Trump called the ruling “a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution.”

    Detained Parents 'Desperate' to Know Where Children Are

   WASHINGTON — Among the parents of more than 2,300 separated migrant children, three Central American parents sued the U.S. government over its policy of family separations Wednesday, the day U.S. President Donald Trump, under intense public pressure, ordered an end to the practice.
But three days later, their situation had not changed and they’re “desperate” for information about the whereabouts and well-being of their children, their lawyer said.
“Our clients are being held in detention facilities with no access to information about their children,” said Jerome Wesevich, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid in Brownsville, Texas. “The government has some procedures in place for supplying information. So far those have been entirely inadequate.”
The administration says it is forging ahead with plans to reunite the parents with the thousands of children separated since early May when officials announced a “zero tolerance policy” on illegal entry into the United States.
Late Friday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had reunited about 500 families, saying “all unaccompanied children in their custody” had been reunited with their families.
But the status of many more transferred out of CBP custody remains uncertain. Wesevich said the uncertainty has left the migrant parents in the dark.
“I’d say there is not a lot of optimism,” Wesevich said. “The president’s announcement is not very understandable about what it’s going to mean in practical terms.”
Meanwhile, legal assistance organizations are trying to locate migrant families caught up in the confusion and chaos that followed Trump’s order.
The Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy organization based in Austin, Texas, is leading one of the largest reunification efforts in the state, seeking to reunite as many as 381 immigrants who have been separated from their children.
Texas RioGrande Legal Aid said it would continue its efforts on behalf of the three Central American parents as it awaits clarity about how the government intends to reunite the separated families.
“The point of our lawsuit (is) that they do it as compassionately and quickly as possible,” Wesevich said. “By compassionate, I mean the parents are provided with information on where their children are, how they’re being cared for.”

    US High Court Rules Police Need Warrant to Track Cellphone Location
   </title>

   In a big win for digital privacy advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly ruled Friday that law enforcement authorities generally need a search warrant in order to collect cellphone location data used in criminal investigations.
In Carpenter v. United States, the justices ruled 5-4 that cellphone tower records kept by service providers are protected under the Constitution and that in most cases, law enforcement authorities must seek a search warrant to obtain the information.
In delivering the majority opinion, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the acquisition of "cell site records was a Fourth Amendment search" requiring a warrant.
"A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing into the public sphere," Roberts said.
Roberts was joined by four liberal justices.The rest of the high court's conservative wing dissented.
"We are extremely gratified by the Supreme Court's ruling today that cellphone location data is protected by the Fourth Amendment," said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which had filed a brief in support of Carpenter.
The decision reflects "a growing recognition by the court that the way technology is used in the modern world does affect our privacy rights and that the Fourth Amendment and the Constitution need to recognize that," Crocker said. The Fourth Amendment guards against unreasonable search and seizure.
The Justice Department said it had no comment on the decision.
At issue in the case was whether cellphone users have a "reasonable expectation of privacy" regarding data held by third parties such as a phone provider.
The case was brought before the court by Timothy Carpenter, a man who police said led a series of robberies of cellphone stores in Ohio and Michigan between 2010 and 2011.
After Carpenter and his accomplices were arrested, the FBI requested and received several months' worth of Carpenter's cell site records from two providers. The data included nearly 13,000 location points, showing Carpenter's movements over about four months.
Using the information as evidence, prosecutors were able to obtain a conviction against Carpenter on 11 counts of robbery.

    FBI Agent at Center of Clinton Email Probe Controversy Escorted From Building
   </title>

  <text_body>
   WASHINGTON — Peter Strzok, the senior FBI agent who led the Hillary Clinton investigation and exchanged a series of anti-Trump messages with another agent during the probe, has been escorted out of the bureau’s Washington, D.C. headquarters, his lawyer confirmed on Tuesday.

"Despite being put through a highly questionable process, Pete has complied with every FBI procedure, including being escorted from the building as a part of the ongoing internal proceedings," Aitan Goelman said in a statement emailed to VOA.

CNN, citing an unnamed source, reported that Strzok was escorted out on Friday.
The FBI declined to comment.
Strzok, a veteran counter-intelligence agent, has become a target of President Donald Trump's criticism of the FBI and the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump and his allies have cited the text messages exchanged between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page as evidence of the bureau's institutional bias against him.

"Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry &amp; Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!" Trump tweeted on Sunday.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from his team last year after the Justice Department inspector general examining the FBI's handling of the Clinton probe brought the messages to his attention.
Strzok has since been reassigned to the FBI's human resources department and being investigated for disciplinary action by the bureau's office of professional responsibility.
In one particularly inflammatory message discovered by the inspector general, Strzok wrote "We'll stop it" in response to a text message by Page that Trump might become president.
In his audit of the FBI's investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server, the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, singled out Strzok for his text and instant messages.
The nearly 600-page report, released on Thursday, said that while the messages “cast a cloud” over the FBI’s handling of “the investigation and the investigation’s credibility,” investigators found no evidence that their political bias “directly affected” the email probe.

    Former Federal Prosecutors Urge Sessions to End Family Separations

   A bipartisan group of more than 70 former federal prosecutors is urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the administration's policy of separating illegal immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, adding their voice to a growing chorus calling for an end to a practice that has seen thousands of young children taken away from their parents in recent months.
“Like the majority of Americans, we have been horrified by the images and stories of children torn from their families along our nation’s Southwest Border,” the former United States attorneys wrote in a letter issued late Monday. “And like a majority of Americans, we are appalled that your Zero Tolerance policy has resulted in the unnecessary trauma and suffering of innocent children.”
“But as former United States Attorneys, we also emphasize that the Zero Tolerance policy is a radical departure from previous Justice Department policy, and that it is dangerous, expensive, and inconsistent with the values of the institution in which we served,” they wrote.
The plea comes as Democrats, some Republicans and others urge the administration to end its "zero-tolerance" policy on immigration enforcement.
Sessions announced the policy in April, directing border state prosecutors to take up all cases of unlawful entry referred by the Department of Homeland Security.
Then in May he announced a joint initiative by the departments of justice and homeland security under which "100 percent" of immigrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border would be detained and referred to prosecutors.
Because children cannot accompany their parents to adult detention facilities, they're separated and put in temporary housing while prosecutors determine their parents' fate.
"If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law," Sessions said. "If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border."
The police announcement came after President Donald Trump ordered an end to a policy known as "catch and release," under which immigrants were released from detention while awaiting a court hearing.

    FBI Director Defends Bureau Against Criticism

   WASHINGTON — FBI Director Christopher Wray defended the bureau on Monday against criticisms leveled by Republicans following a scathing inspector general report about its handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton email server investigation.
Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee alongside the Justice Department's inspector general, Wray said the internal audit focused on the conduct of a “small number” of FBI employees during the email probe and did not reflect on the larger institution.
“Mistakes made by those employees do not define our 37,000 men and women and the great work they do every day,” Wray said. “Nothing in this report impugns the integrity of our workforce as a whole or the FBI as an institution.”
The FBI is determined to avoid repeating the mistakes identified in the 600-page report, Wray said, adding that he’d already started acting on some of its recommendations, including referring misconduct highlighted by the report to the bureau's disciplinary arm
The comments followed the release last Thursday of the report by the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, on the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.
The report blasted former FBI Director James Comey for “deviating” from long-standing policies and procedures during the investigation but said there was no evidence that “political bias” or other “improper considerations” had impacted the investigation.
The review also criticized five FBI employees involved in the investigation for exchanging anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages during the probe, including two senior officials -- Peter Strzok and Lisa Page -- who also worked for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
The inspector general said that while he found no evidence that “improper considerations, including political bias,” influenced the Clinton email investigation, the messages “cast a cloud over the FBI’s handling of the investigation and the investigation’s credibility.”
Mueller removed Strzok from his team after the inspector general flagged the pair last August. Page left the team and resigned from the FBI last month.

    Trump: DoJ Report Biased, Reached Wrong Conclusion
   </title>

  <text_body>
   WASHINGTON — United States President Donald Trump said Friday the Justice Department's inspector general's report on the Hillary Clinton email probe reached the wrong conclusion when it determined there was no bias in the agency's handling of the investigation.
"The end result was wrong," Trump said in an interview on the Fox News Channel. "There was total bias when you look at [FBI agent] Peter Strzok, what he said about me, when you look at [then-FBI Director James] Comey and all his moves."
In his first remarks about the report, Trump tweeted earlier Friday the report proves that Comey was an ineffective leader of the FBI and said he did the country "a great service" when he fired Comey.
Trump first took Strzok to task Friday on Twitter for texting during the investigation that "we'll stop" Trump from winning the presidency, a revelation that was disclosed when the report was issued Thursday, and Trump praised current FBI Director Christopher Wray for his leadership of the embattled agency.
In the report, the Justice Department's internal auditor on sharply criticized Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe during the 2016 election, but said investigators found no evidence that his conduct was motivated by "political bias."
In the long-awaited report, the department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, blasted Comey for a series of controversial steps he took during the investigation, including publicly exonerating Clinton in the midst of the campaign and then reopening — and later closing — the probe just as the November election was drawing near.
Comey's move to clear the Democratic candidate of any wrongdoing at a July 5, 2016 press conference, without coordinating with the attorney general, "was extraordinary and insubordinate," the inspector general wrote, while his decision to send a letter to members of Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, despite the attorney general's opposition, informing them that he was reopening the investigation, constituted "a serious error of judgment."
These and other missteps by Comey and other FBI and Justice Department officials damaged the FBI's credibility, Horowitz concluded in his 500-page review of the investigation, which took 18 months to complete.

    IG Faults Comey's Judgment But Sees No Bias

   WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department’s internal auditor on Thursday sharply criticized former FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe during the 2016 election, but said investigators found no evidence that Comey’s conduct was motivated by “political bias.”
In a long-awaited report, the department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, took Comey to task for a series of controversial steps he took during the investigation, including publicly exonerating Clinton in the midst of the campaign and then reopening — and later closing — the probe just as the November election was drawing near.
Comey’s move to clear the Democratic candidate of any wrongdoing at a July 5, 2016, press conference, without informing the attorney general, “was extraordinary and insubordinate,” while his decision to send a letter to members of Congress on October 28, 2016, despite the attorney general’s opposition, informing them that he was reopening the investigation, constituted “a serious error of judgment,” the inspector general wrote.
These and other missteps by Comey and other FBI and Justice Department officials damaged the FBI’s credibility, Horowitz concluded in his 500-page review of the investigation. The report took 18 months to complete.
“While we did not find that these decisions were the result of political bias on Comey’s part, we nevertheless concluded that by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice,” Horowitz wrote.
Comey has stood by his actions. He told investigators the FBI found itself in the middle of a “500-year flood” and that he “weighed the need to preserve the credibility and integrity of the Department and the FBI.”
In a recently released book, Comey wrote that he decided to do “something I could never imagine” in order to protect the bureau’s reputation after concluding that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch “appeared politically compromised” by her association to the Clintons.
In a Twitter message posted Thursday afternoon, Comey wrote that the inspector general’s “conclusions are reasonable, even though I disagree with some.”
“People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation,” he wrote.

    Lawyers to Challenge Sessions' Ruling In Asylum Case
   </title>

   WASHINGTON — Lawyers for a Salvadoran woman at the center of a controversial ruling on asylum by Attorney General Jeff Sessions say they are looking to challenge the decision that could prevent tens of thousands of immigrants from being granted asylum.
In a sweeping opinion that has touched off an outcry among immigration rights advocates, Sessions on Monday reversed a 2016 grant of asylum to the woman who had been abused by her husband, ruling that victims of domestic violence are not generally eligible for asylum under U.S. immigration law.
While the decision applies to all seeking asylum on grounds of domestic and gang violence, applicants from Mexico and the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, could be hit especially hard, advocates say. The four countries accounted for 35 percent of asylum claims filed with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in March.
Though Sessions directed his ruling at immigration judges, its effect could be felt beyond the court system, said Blaine Bookey, a co-legal director at the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, which is representing the Salvadoran woman.
“The attorney general’s decision applies to all adjudicators, including the appellate body, the immigration courts, as well as the Asylum Office, even down to the border officers who are doing the initial threshold screenings of individuals,” Bookey said.
A recent uptick in the rejection rate of asylum cases could accelerate, she said. “This decision only provides further support to officers who would not want to recognize certain claims."
But she said the attorney general’s decision in the case is not necessarily the final word.
The Salvadoran woman, known by her initials A.B., can still pursue one of three forms of fear-based relief in the U.S., including asylum, withholding from deportation and seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture, she said.
The center is also examining other options to challenge Sessions’ ruling, including through the litigation of other individual asylum claims that may be negatively impacted by the decision, Bookey said.

    New Charges Filed Against Manafort in Russia Probe

   The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election escalated the pressure Friday on President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, bringing additional charges against him and a long-time associate for attempting to tamper with potential witnesses.
The new charges accuse Manafort, 69, and Konstantin Kilimnik, 48, of intentionally attempting to “corruptly persuade” two unidentified people “with intent to influence, delay, and prevent” their testimony. The contacts took place between February and April of this year.
They were both charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice. Manafort was already facing five other criminal charges in connection with his lobbying efforts on behalf of Ukraine's former government.
Kilimnik, who ran the Kyev office of Manafort's political consulting firm, becomes the 20th person indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller who is investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to sway the outcome of the election.
The latest charges, issued by a federal grand jury, come after the special counsel said in court filings on Monday (June 4) that Manafort and an associate — now identified as Kilimnik — had "repeatedly" contacted two potential witnesses in an effort to sway their testimony.
Prosecutors said the two unidentified people worked with Manafort in organizing the so-called Hapsburg Group, an organization of former European officials enlisted to lobby EU officials and members of Congress on Ukraine’s behalf.
The two people told investigators that Manafort and Kilimnik had recently tried to get them to claim that the Hapsburg Group lobbying effort focused only on Europe.
In one message intercepted by investigators, Manafort wrote to one potential witness that “I have made it clear that they worked in Europe." In another intercepted message, Kilimnik told the second potential witness that “our friends never lobbied in the U.S.
Mueller’s prosecutors then asked the federal judge presiding over Manafort's case in Washington to revoke or revise Manafort’s release conditions, which could potentially result in Manafort being jailed while he awaits trial.
Manafort is currently free on house arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in the prManafort is currently free on house arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in the previous two indictments. evious two indictments.

    Bill Would Let US States Enforce Own Marijuana Laws

   A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday unveiled new legislation that would allow states to choose their own marijuana laws, despite a 48-year-old federal prohibition on cannabis.
While the bill would not lift the ban, it seeks to amend the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, exempting the production, possession and distribution of marijuana in states where it's legal.
The bill's sponsors cast it in terms of states' rights, saying the legislation ensures that "each state has the right to determine for itself the best approach to marijuana within its borders."
"The federal government is closing its eyes and plugging its ears while 46 states have acted," said Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the first state in the nation to legalize recreational marijuana. "The bipartisan, commonsense bill ensures the federal government will respect the will of the voters — whether that is legalization or prohibition — and not interfere in any states' legal marijuana industry."
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another state that allows recreational marijuana use, said federal cannabis laws "have perpetuated our broken criminal justice system, created barriers to research, and hindered economic development."
"States like Massachusetts have put a lot of work into implementing commonsense marijuana regulations — and they have the right to enforce their own marijuana policies," she said. "The federal government needs to get out of the business of outlawing marijuana."
The impetus for the legislation was a decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January to rescind Obama-era Justice Department guidelines that encouraged prosecutors to adopt a hands-off approach to marijuana law enforcement in states where the substance was legal.
Instead, Sessions directed U.S. attorneys general around the country to "enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities."
The decision proved controversial. While several leading law enforcement associations backed the move, it was excoriated by marijuana advocates, civil libertarians and states with pro-marijuana measures. Shares of publicly traded marijuana companies plummeted.
Leading the charge against the decision was Gardner, who blocked key Justice Department nominees who require Senate confirmation, triggering a standoff with the White House.

    US Sees National Security Threat in Drone Popularity

   WASHINGTON — The proliferation of nonmilitary drones in the United States poses a growing national security threat, top U.S. security and aviation officials warned Wednesday as they pressed Congress to pass legislation that would allow agents to target and potentially take down suspicious drones.
While the recreational and commercial use of drones has skyrocketed in recent years — there are now more than 1 million unmanned aircraft in the U.S. — criminals and terrorist increasingly use the technology for nefarious purposes, according to officials from the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Aviation Administration, who testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
“While (drone) technology offers tremendous benefits to the economy and society, we recognize the misuse of this technology poses unique security challenges,” said Angela H. Stubblefield, deputy associate administrator for the FAA.
Scott Brunner, a deputy assistant director of the FBI, said the bureau is “concerned that criminals and terrorists will exploit (unmanned aircraft systems) in ways that pose a serious threat to the safety of the American people.”
Terrorists and criminals could use drones to conduct illegal surveillance, carry out chemical, biological and radiological attacks as well as more traditional attacks on large open air venues such as concerts, sporting events and government facilities, Brunner said.
“That threat could manifest itself imminently,” he said.
The FAA has registered more than 1 million drones, including 122,000 primarily commercial and public drones. The agency said the number could grow to as many as 4 million by 2021.
In recent years, drones have grown cheaper, easier to use and more widely available. Their use has multiplied, for purposes ranging from aerial photography to firefighting and dust cropping.
They’re also hard to detect, making the technology attractive to terrorists and criminals. Islamic State and other terrorist groups have used them to conduct reconnaissance and launch attacks, posting videos of their exploits online. Officials said criminals have used unmanned aircraft to traffic drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border, conduct surveillance to evade law enforcement, and fly contraband into prisons. Last year, criminals used small drones to block FBI agents from observing a hostage situation, an official said last month.

    US Top Court Sides With Baker in Gay Wedding Cake Case
   </title>

   WASHINGTON — In a closely watched case pitting gay rights against religious freedom, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday narrowly ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused on religious grounds to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple six years ago.
The justices voted 7-2 that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated the rights of baker Jack Phillips under the First Amendment’s clause on the free exercise of religion when it ordered him to provide cakes for same sex couples, despite his religious objection to gay marriage.
Though a victory for Phillips, the ruling was notably narrow, with justices leaving aside the larger constitutional question of whether private businesses can refuse service to gay people, as a number have in recent years.
“The court wrote about the narrowest opinion it could write and still come up on the side of the baker,” said Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at the Georgetown Law Center. “Because it wrote a very narrow opinion and tried to decide the case as narrowly as possible, I don’t think it sets as important a precedent as some people feared it might.”
The case dates back to 2012, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins went to Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to order a custom cake for their wedding.
Phillips, a devout Christian, declined, saying doing so would amount to participating in a religious ceremony antithetical to his religious beliefs.
The couple complained to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and later sued Phillips. The commission and state courts found that Phillips had violated Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws. Colorado is one of 22 states that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Phillips appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that the state’s anti-discrimination law violated his religious liberty and freedom of expression, both protected by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has authored some of the court’s key gay rights rulings in recent years, including a landmark 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage, delivered the majority opinion, writing that the Colorado commission “showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating (Phillips’) objection” to designing a cake for the gay couple.

   Even as it signals a willingness to give up its nuclear arms, North Korea is brandishing another well-known weapon in its arsenal: cyber.
Under heavy sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, the cash-starved government in Pyongyang has for many years used cyberattacks to steal money from banks and other institutions.
Those intrusions are continuing, primarily in Asia and Latin America, even as U.S. President Donald Trump says that a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will proceed later this month, according to a U.S. cybersecurity firm that advises companies and government agencies that have been breached by hackers.
"We continue to see offensive operations by North Korean actors," Charles Carmakal, vice president at Mandiant Consulting, a subsidiary of cybersecurty firm FireEye, told VOA. "There are multiple intrusions discovered this year and some of them are ongoing."
Theresa Payton, CEO of leading security firm Fortalice Solutions, who served as chief information officer for the White House under former President George W. Bush, said the North Koreans are not simply after money.
"This is an opportunity for them to flex their muscle and to say, 'If you think you're going to take our nukes, and if you think you're going to put us under economic sanctions, we just want you to know this is a weapon and we're not afraid to use it,' " Payton told VOA.
Among the multiple North Korean hackers tracked this year by FireEye is a group known as Lazarus, which was responsible for an $81 million cybertheft from the Bangladesh Central Bank in 2016.
"The Lazarus group, which is the more destructive of the threat actors that operate in North Korea, tends to go after financial institutions that have large volumes of money that could be robbed," Carmakal said.
The institutions being targeted by the North Korean hackers are based in Latin America and Asia, he said, declining to name them or the countries from which they operate.
North Korea's long-term plan "is to generate wealth by stealing it from other organizations across the globe," Carmakal said, estimating Pyongyang's cybercrime revenue in the range of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars.

    National Security Division Focuses on Combating Cyberthreats

   The U.S. Justice Department's National Security Division, created in response to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, is increasingly focused on an emergent menace: cyberthreats posed by foreign countries, from Russia to China, the division head said Thursday.
"In the past years, [the division's mission] has come increasingly to include a focus on cyber as part of the threat posed by certain foreign nations," said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, citing the prosecution in recent years of hackers acting on behalf of China, Russia, Iran and the Islamic State terror group.
Over the past two years, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have been sounding alarm bells about cyberthreats presented by a variety of foreign actors, from Russian government efforts to disrupt U.S. elections to Chinese companies trying to steal U.S. trade secrets.
In a report released in February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the worldwide cyberthreat was on the rise.
"The potential for surprise in the cyber realm will increase in the next year and beyond as billions more digital devices are connected — with relatively little built-in security — and both nation states and malign actors become more emboldened and better equipped in the use of increasingly widespread cyber toolkits," the report said. "The risk is growing that some adversaries will conduct cyberattacks — such as data deletion or localized and temporary disruptions of critical infrastructure — against the United States in a crisis short of war."
The National Security Division, one of the Justice Department's seven key units, was created in 2006 as part of the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, a controversial law that Congress passed in response to terror threats in the weeks after 9/11.
Speaking at a cyberthreat intelligence forum in Washington, Demers warned that foreign state and nonstate actors continued to pose a threat to U.S. national security.
"You know that there are countries in this world that want what we have," Demers said. "They want our sensitive information, our technology, our intellectual property. And they want to destroy any competitive advantage we enjoy."

    US House Bill Targets Recidivism with Enhanced Prison Job Training
   </title>
   <url>
    https://www.voanews.com//a/us-house-passes-1st-major-criminal-justice-reform-measure-in-8-years/4406025.html

  <text_body>
   CAPITOL HILL — The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA.
A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.”
If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide $50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates.
But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate.
In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization.
Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.”
He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans.
“Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, said, speaking of the bill’s reform measures on the House floor Tuesday.

    House Republicans Clear Key First Step to Send Tax Bill to Trump
   </title>

   The U.S. House of Representatives passed significant changes to the nation's tax code for the first time in three decades and by a comfortable vote margin Thursday, giving President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans a much-needed win after a year of legislative setbacks.
"If we get Tax Cuts and Reform, we'll really see some great results!," the president tweeted early Friday, after noting the "Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy."
Later, Trump tweeted, "If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes, we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill!" but he did not list the Democratic ideas to which he was referring.
"This is nothing short of extraordinary," House Speaker Paul Ryan said after the vote, noting that getting the needed number of 218 House members to agree on anything was an achievement.
Ryan's long-held goal of reforming the nation's tax code appeared in jeopardy earlier this year after Republicans tried and failed to deliver on another long-term campaign promise: repealing and replacing former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Republican leadership appeared visibly relaxed on the House floor as the vote totals moved toward passage and earlier in the day after Trump gave a last-minute speech of encouragement at the party's weekly conference meeting.

"Every step of the way, President Trump was directly engaged, kept talking about how he wanted to push those tax cuts further and further down to the middle class, to make sure that this was fair for everybody," House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said Thursday of Trump's efforts.
The president did not address anticipated issues with passing the legislation in the U.S. Senate, telling House Republicans it was time to put American businesses on a competitive playing field.
"The president is on the verge of getting a major win today and, more importantly, being able to sign the first tax overhaul since 1986, so it's a critical moment for us — he made it pretty clear," Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, said of Trump's trip to Capitol Hill.

    US Congress Weighs Sanctions on Myanmar Military Over Rohingya Crisis
   </title>

  <text_body>
   Proposed sanctions against the Myanmar military should move quickly through the U.S. Congress due to strong bipartisan support, lawmakers told VOA.
The Burma Sanctions Bill in the House of Representatives and a companion bill in the Senate would apply economic pressure on military generals with the aim of ending the ongoing violence inflicted on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
"This sends a very strong message to the Burmese military that we're not going to tolerate business as usual while they reap economic profits at the same time as they are perpetuating ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people," said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
In a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the crisis last month, Chairman Ed Royce called on Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to be more forceful in condemning the crisis that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Many have fled to neighboring Bangladesh.
"Those responsible for these atrocities must face justice. She and the military generals must rise to this challenge," Royce said. "This is ethnic cleansing."
Engel said it is important for Aung San Suu Kyi to speak out about the crisis, "but we also have to take it in the context where her hands are tied because she's not able to do things because of the way the constitution was written."
A spokesman for Myanmar's leader told the Reuters news service, "We need internal stability to improve the country's economy. Imposing international sanctions directly affects the people in travel and in business investments, and there are many bad consequences."
The House bill's Republican co-sponsor told VOA the sanctions are meant to give Aung San Suu Kyi more leverage with the military.
"We would be able to work with her perhaps to relieve sanctions once in place if the military does reform itself and does certainly cease the hostilities and the atrocities that have occurred," said Representative Steve Chabot, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
